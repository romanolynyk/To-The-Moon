The company itself is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of coding and sata structuring most of the tech and its applications will go over a typical investors head. There's also societys nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into a dystopian high tech future- this philosophy draws heavily from Orwellian literature, for instance. The PLTR investor understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this company, to realize that they're not just a company- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the inclination in what PLTRs CEO said when he said, ""We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxleys magnum opus Brave New World. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Alexander Karp's genius wit unfolds itself on their brokerage sites.

The company itself is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of coding and sata structuring most of the tech and its applications will go over a typical investors head. There's also societys nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into a dystopian high tech future- this philosophy draws heavily from Orwellian literature, for instance. The PLTR investor understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this company, to realize that they're not just a company- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the inclination in what PLTRs CEO said when he said, ""We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxleys magnum opus Brave New World.

My PLTR spread is nervous a little as I got 01/15/21 25c, 27.5c, but also sold bunch of 29c and 32c a day before yesterday when it was spike.

In this case, do I sell calls I have and buy back the calls I sold? Or I should just let it ride as I have more call at lower target bought than calls I sold?

I don't worry about 32C, if it stays under 29 that would be the best, but it just passed 27.

WTF kind of logic is this? Why do you assume the insiders know it's going to double, and it's not going to be like every other post IPO lockout?  If it's such a sure thing, just tell us what they know...

In reality, these insiders have had to sit around with their private nontransferable shares for up to 17 years... and now they are *finally* liquid. If they got their shares from exercising employee stock options, they had to pay taxes on that already (at the time of exercising: current valuation minus the strike price) years ago and have been salivating over dumping their shares and finally cashing at least some of it out.

3737,PLTR,2021-01-14 19:44:24," Tyler Radke that downgraded it didn't do his homework well. Pretty sure he spent all of 20 minutes reading the prospectus document of PLTR, saw a few negatives and literally gave a PT of $10 based on last quarter's earnings and the negatives.

I think he really believes that PLTR is worth $10.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing DD everyday for the past month and a half for at least 8 hours a day up to 16 hours a day for PLTR. I'm full schizzoid mode on PLTR right now, i read the whole 311 pages of the prospectus and i come from a development background and i fully understand Palantir and how well they are positioned right now...

I can tell you Palantir is NOT a $10 stock. Palantir will VERY quickly rise to the 200-600 dollar price range over the next 2-4 years and we're easily going to see 44-89 by March or April THIS YEAR.

The rocket is 3/5'ths full and the shuttle doors are going to close when we're almost full. When the rocket goes... it's not coming down again. Soros and his 1% stake can't do shit. Stakeholders will trim positions but not massively sell off, the dip will get bought and we'll go to the moon.

Today a new part of the government was announced: Artificial Intelligence Office which will be under the Technology and Scieneces department. This branch will be working directly with private companies like PLTR, but really they're going to be working 95% with PLTR and 5% other vendors just because it's not cost effective for them to pay PLTR to make certain features for them. PLTR is already balls deep with the government and with Biden, the balls are going deeper.

There's also societys nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into a dystopian high tech future- this philosophy draws heavily from Orwellian literature, for instance. The PLTR investor understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this company, to realize that they're not just a company- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the inclination in what PLTRs CEO said when he said, ""We believe in augmenting human intelligence, not replacing it,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Huxleys magnum opus Brave New World.

AK: Hello everyone, we are so excited to show you our Gotham capabilities on this glorious day.

*Pulls up table on main screen*

AK: Here at PLTR, we are so good at data analytics.  Gotham here was able to parse through hundreds of thousands of comments on a subreddit called /r/wallstreetbets to find our most naiv... I mean... supportive supporters!

AK: Mind you, these comments are created by hundreds and thousands of autists so interpreting the comments is a challenge in of itself.  But, **with the power of Gotham**, we are able to show you who holds the largest position at the highest price point in all of /r/wallstreetbets!

*Points at you through the screen*

I can't say I've used PLTR myself, but you are right in saying that PLTR is the best and is aiming to be the highest premium tool for corporate businesses. Doing anything in-house regarding coding (simple ppc scripts/ machine learning) is often costly but once PLTR gets it done and can make the process fairly automatic I think they're probably going to rule the data world.

GME will rally until at least June/July, when RC announces the plan moving forward. On top of that, yesterday was more of a ‚Äúcorrection‚Äù than it was the fallout of us collectively fucking the Shorts. Stay in at least until then, and buy more shares if you can up until. 

As far as PLTR goes, though...

  NPR just this morning had a story about the biometrics the US Army has collected in nearly every encounter with a suspected/known insurgent. Fingerprints, DNA, known associations, all that shit.

Now let me ask you: who do you think is managing all that data and doing the analytics for them, hmmmm? 

PLTR is an even longer play than GME, maybe even more profitable, but it won‚Äôt be as sexy. We made history yesterday with GameStop. It‚Äôs a wild success story, and you should be proud to be a part of it. Show that pride by buying more shares, and hold them until the Shorts are fucked into oblivion. Then we can focus on PLTR.

Why ""now""?  GME still has a fuck ton of space to run, and it's already got hooks in it.  Plus, as a smaller cap stock with a lot fewer outstanding shares, it's eminently more movable.  It wouldn't surprise me to see this thing up 100% from today's close in a couple of weeks.  Plus, even though institutional investors see it as wildly overbought, there's no conviction to stamp it back down.

Why PLTR?  I get, last year, why it was a darling here, but there are a lot of things going against it.  For one, it's a big, lumbering company that's going to be a lot harder to move.  Picture moving a rock the size of a golf ball up a hill vs. a rock the size of a beach ball.  It's severely tied into government contracts, which are droll kind of dull investments that are generally baked into price well in advance.  Not going to be a lot of ""surprises"" there.  And the downward pressure conviction on the equity, especially since around Thanksgiving, has been significant.  Institutional investors WANT to send it down.  Why pick such a difficult fight?  There's basically no resistance in the other WSB darling ($GME) right now.  It floated up to 38 today without a lick of resistance and only came back down as people jizzed and took profits.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Alex's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike PLTR truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Alex's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Peter Thiel's genius wit unfolds itself on their screens.

More money can make more money.  If your fucking around with value meal money, you're going to get value meal returns.  A 20% return on 10 grand is a lot more to ppay around with than 20% return on a 500 dollar play. Build your account up.  Treat it like a savings account.  Maybe invest in some stocks that give a solid return year over while you build up enough cash to be able to not gamble it on an FD tesla call.  

If you're making a play with a big chunk of your portfolio, for fucks sake buy it out at least a month on the exp date.  Give yourself some time to exit the position.

5437,PLTR,2021-01-13 20:32:21,"So here's a tip now that I can post again. 

Options are now available today for the ticker that I got banned for posting about while you guys were bag holding PLTR.

For a time while I was banned, it actually met the criteria to be posted here. The only reason It's not currently is due to market cap (which is a GOOD thing because it means that the company is still very cheap for what you pay)

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the trick. 

If you have a decent amount of cash on hand, you can write 2/19 $5 puts on the ticker.  
Right now the puts are bidding for 1.25.  


So lets say you write some 2/19 $5 puts.

The two possible outcomes are  


1. The puts expire worthless and you keep $125 for every contract you sold.
2. You get assigned and have to buy 100 shares at $5 each for every contract you sold.

One thing to point out is that for outcome 2, If you get assigned you still keep the premium meaning your cost basis per share is only $3.75 which is actually a ridiculous deal considering the public offering to institutions sold out yesterday at a discounted price of $3.05 per share which immediately sold out.   


If you do your research on the stock or take a peek at the symposium that is going on now, you would FOMO your ass in at even the current market price.",0.6395748299319728,0.07153911564625852,0.068,0.877,0.056,-0.482

As the price goes up, other shorts are dragged into it, and they too have to cover their position and buy more. Shorting is a bit harder to get your head round than calls. What is quite interesting with gme is that they have a stack of revenue, but the market cap is low. 

The fundamentals of the company have not change yet, this is quite a big yet as if they can turn the company around and somehow magically keep the revenue then you could see stock price rises due to actually, ya know, make money. You could make a strong argument that this is underway, only time will tell if they are successful with this. Their revenue is 5 times that of pltr, both have negative income, pltr also has a market cap about 40 times more than gme. Basically, people believe gme might go bankrupt, which they might, but they are also sat on a fair bit of cash. The more I think about it, it's a really interesting stock; classic bear vs bull.

Bro they literally lied to you about having a working prototype and then in an official statement never denied or provided any proof towards Citrons claims and then said 'it's cool that we lied because it was a technicality, and technically the vehicle was 'running' when it was gravity pushing it down a hill'. They literally said that, the CEO bailed out a few weeks later and then their deal to actually make vehicles fell through and now you're hyped on news that they're BUYING HYDROGEN

The breakout pattern matches most of tech and the earlier days of our favorite PND stocks like TSLA. 

Daily chart is looking strong with a bullish hammer candle stick (subject to change as the day trades).

Oh I can hear you bears now, trust me, I am very bear-curious. This is how you make it all back. Don't believe me? Come to my house at the Fed Reserve and say it to my face, pussy.

This means he'd decrease the supply of oil &amp; gas, which will make the price go up. He has expressed some interest in a version of cash for clunkers. That's as much as we can expect him to get through this Congress. Meanwhile, expect big increases in oil and gas consumption across Asia. 

I expect the price of XOM to rise in the intermediate future so that the dividend yield isn't so out of whack. Eventually the stock price will put the yield somewhere in the 4% ballpark.

6795,PLTR,2021-01-13 09:40:05,"I've commented on PLTR software before seen as I actually use it. PLTR is an all in one solution for data storage, analysis and viz that gives you a lot of control. SNOW does the data lake part and does it well like OP stated. PLTR does it even better and give you a shit ton of tools for both business users and devs/data engineers/analysts in an integrated fashion. You can make data pipelines using Spark in PLTR (in Python or Java), run SQL queries on datasets in a scalable fashion. And the biggest point is no need to configure anything, just give a user access to PLTR and they're set.   


Imagine your tech stack is from loads of different vendors and you have to work your ass off to make the connections between them. PLTR isn't like this and is a top-down solution  for all the points I gave above. Why the fuck would you make your life difficult using loads of tools and having the same kind of vendor lock-in when you can use PLTR and have all of your users onboarded quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an actual user I am 10% sold on what PLTR is doing, and Demo Day is going to be huge for the company. When data science/analysts finally fucking understand what Foundry does I think some minds are going to be blown. If the presentation goes well I think the questions regarding SNOW vs PLTR are going to be irrelevant and people will see how PLTR is superior in a lot of ways.

If you look at his post, he basically doesn't have any real reasons to purchase besides it's tech. How do we know he doesn't have ten alts and just posts about tech stocks randomly?

Additionally, this guys DD reaks of pump and dump. ""I told you so"" is as cult mentality as it gets. PLTR really hasn't had the time it needs to report earnings if we're being real. Long plays are really the way to go, if you're trying to speculate and gamble, GME, TSLA, and NIO are all better in the short term meme potential, they're worth doesn't have to be proven, tweets move the price of those stocks like nothing else.

PLTR is going to continue to fuck everyone that isn't diamond hands, frankly. Like what announcement are you betting on happening that will move PLTR up? More contracts? Another countries retirement fund pouring cash in? And don't get all high and mighty because you're not a Boomer, I'm about as plugged into this space as possible and I didn't hear about these guys until after the IPO. This tech is literally all black box, if you went up to the smartest dude working in PLTR and asked him, so exactly how does your tech work? He'd kinda look at you funny and either reply ""frankly I don't really know"" or proceed with a multi-semester lecture on the complexities and nuances of creating AI systems and at the end of it you'd still go ""oh we really don't know"". 

So, frankly, investors don't know what to do with this stupid ass stock. It sounds like the biggest scam ever ""a tech stock that can't explain how it does what it does""; however they have the mfing receipts if you really want proof that they can do the things they say they can do to some capacity. But that's like super technical stuff that I wouldn't really qualify myself to analyze and verify, but I've seen other's analysis off this board and it's enough for me to go all in lmao.

Scroll around and you‚Äôll still find the poor souls asking when PLTR will pump again as they got killed and refuse to sell.   

Not saying ICLN is a bad idea, just think it‚Äôs horrible timing.  I‚Äôd also add PLUG, FCEL and even TSLA to this list.  There are sooooo many good stocks find one which gone up 20% in the last week.

Example being me. I started with 5k and dropped all the way to 1.9k because I was stupid as hell and fell for FOMO (feeling of missing out) when PLTR really started taking off. I've been a lot smarter and have turned it into 8k now nearly.

Best advice I can give you is almost every time you should take your profits and run. There will always be another stock and another play. When you see red don't be an idiot and sell every time to save yourself more losses unless you know it's a fucked stock. Shit always rebounds in one way or another.

Positive earnings for early life, their 2012-2016 ""lost money"" was spent in genius acquisitions, and miniscule given they were raking 8B a year to sustain the operation.  Positive.  Cash.  Flow.

that $8M hyper switch tho

7552,PLTR,2021-01-12 14:24:26,"None of this is actual investing/trading advice. The info below is based on a 10 minute glance at PLTR's investor relations and press release sections of their website.

According to PLTR's [Q3 report](https://s26.q4cdn.com/381064750/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Palantir-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation-1.pdf) the average Revenue per customer was $5,800,000 (9 months ended 9/30/20). Adjusted on a quarterly basis that's **~$1.93M/quarter.**

Here's a breakdown of some recent Palantir contracts I've read about in their Press Releases.

12/8/20 - [FDA](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005711/en/Palantir-Technologies-Expands-FDA-Partnership-With-44m-Contract) - $44,400,000 (three years)

1/4/21 - [SOMPO Holdings](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005171/en/Palantir-Technologies-Expands-Japan-Business-with-New-22.5-Million-Contract) - $22,500,000 (one year)

1/6/21 - [Fujitsu](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210106005230/en/Fujitsu-Limited-Signs-8-Million-Contract-as-Palantir-Foundry-Customer-and-Becomes-First-Distributor-of-Foundry-Modules-in-Japan) - $8,000,000 (one year)

1/11/21 - [Army PEO](https://www.afcea.org/content/army-peo-iews-selects-palantir-and-raytheon-compete-titan-effort) - $8,500,000 (one year)

Here's a summary:

Break those down to a average rev/quarter basis and you have **~$3.5M/quarter** for these four contracts.

There are undoubtedly smaller contracts they're securing without issuing press releases. Based on these four contracts announced over the last 35 days the average revenue per customer per quarter is increasing. 

HOWEVER:

The Q3 statement also notes the average revenue per customer for their *top 20 customers* is $23,600,000 (9 months ended 9/30/20) - adjusted on quarterly basis that's $7.86M/quarter. I don't know how they categorize customers. Is the entire US gov't one customer? Or do they look at the FDA and US Army as separate customers? Even still, the contracts they're announcing fall well under their *top 20 customer* revenue benchmark.

I've been long PLTR since its IPO with an average of $11.75/share. I may wait for earnings and see what analysts' sentiments are but I will likely be adding to my position.",0.4153703703703704,0.002962962962962958,0.0,0.975,0.025,0.5204

Further, the entry to establish in their market is high so they have little equal competition for what they can do. Also, high evaluations are good for companies... Tesla, for example, has made a ton of money through offerings, which will be able to sustain research and other costs for years to come. As for Palantir, they have gone up %130 since their IPO...

Let's now pretend that each of us is investing $1,000. You can argue that number quite a bit, but seeing a lot of the posts on here, I think some users are definitely investing enough to compensate for everyone else. I think it's too low, but it's just as a proof of concept.

Now, that actually means that we're moving around $1.5b throughout the market. With a lot of the meme stocks and our herd mentality, a lot of those are going into the same companies (GME, PLTR, NIO, TSLA, etc). That's a lot of money. And like i said, I think I'm once again underestimating the amount of money we're moving through the market. 

Honestly, we're pretty huge. I think once we realize how much power we have, we'll start being able to intentionally artificially inflate stocks. Take Signal for example. Lord Elon says ""Use Signal"" and a completely different company skyrockets.

It makes sense that eventually we'll be ""infiltrated"". Imagine having a way of getting a bunch of autists over inflate your companies share prices. It's a lot of power.",0.49206349206349204,0.04246031746031746,0.03,0.87,0.1,0.9584

You're right, its a gamble. Lock-up ending will lead to the moon or send us into a spiral. At the end of the day though, I agree with a lot of the DD's and my own DD - pltr will continue to grow, maybe not astronomically all at once, but steadily. Its a long term hold. I'm happy making my money off CC's and CSPs on this stock, and am not sweating what February brings.

8821,PLTR,2021-01-10 22:07:14,"Oh man, I've been getting a lot of questions about how to use this. The stupidity is so much worse than what I thought. First, save it to your own google drive. You need your own copy. Then, and let me make this very clear, *fill in the blanks with the information stated in the title.*

eg. You enter a YOLO of PLTR tomorrow, so you fill in ""01/10/2021"" under Column A. Next, since it's still open, you select ""open"" under Column B. Step 3, what's your position? Since it's WSB, I'm going to guess the weekly 30C; so, enter ""BOT +500 PLTR 15 JAN 21 30 Call @ .16"". Setting a GTC closing order isn't a thing in WSB, so leave closing trade blank until you actually close out or when your position inevitably expires worthless. Once it does that, enter the closing trade just like the opening trade. Just like the opening date, enter the date you placed your closing trade in Column E. Column F is for the price you paid or the credit you received to open your position - this part is important. Keep it in terms of dollars; for options, don't multiply by 100, it does it for you automatically. Whether or not you paid a debit or received a credit, use the dropdown menu in Column G to select the right one (people here don't sell premium, so just go ahead and select debit). Once you close out of your position, fill the credit you received in Column H, and notate that it was a credit in Column I. Instrument is whether you bought/sold an option or stock - this is when the sheet will multiply by 100 if it's an option. Guess what you do under ""position size"" - that's right! You enter the amount of contracts or stocks you purchased. Then you're done. The excel sheet fills in the rest.

Oof I never thought I'd have to explain simple data entry.",0.5180119047619048,0.041142857142857134,0.03,0.887,0.083,0.9487

Snowflake's biggest play right now is data mobility, and some security plays (doomed to fail IMO), not pure EDW/EDM. The fact they can run on major CSPs and have cheaper storage and more efficient compression to power the mobility than Amazon S3 and Azure Blob says a lot.

Once the CSPs start getting in on efficient compression and removing data transfer caveats (AWS is getting close with DataSync, Strong Consistency on S3) then that play goes out the window. AWS already fed them their lunch with Redshift and boomer fucktards on prem like to keep their Neteeza and Teradata for some reason. So I see Snowflake taking a shit within 2 years, maybe 4 as some of their longer term agreements expire.

And dont get me started on their stupid ass ""security data lake"" idea.

I don‚Äôt know how familiar you guys are with this but basically ‚ÄúFibonacci‚Äù is a phenomena, mathematical formula that appears in nature. And it also appears in the financial markets. Most charting software should have a ‚ÄúFibonacci retracement‚Äù tool. You use it to draw a line from bottom to top on a continuous move up and it reveals certain levels below and above the top point. And then when the stock ‚Äúpulls back‚Äù or retraces, the tools will tell you at what level the stock retraced to. And the stock land usually right on the money on one of the retracement levels. And the tool also has an extension level at the top that tells you because the stock retraces to THIS level the next move UP is to THIS level. PLTR did a big move up before what it‚Äôs doing now which is kind of dancing around. But it has also pulled back from the old high. And it retraced right down to the .618 retracement level. And therefore the next move up is to the 1.618 extension on the fib tool. And the price at that extension level is $44.20. But guys you should know that anything could happen. There could be a slew of bad news that takes the market down next week and the trade becomes ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. All these levels tell you that if everything goes as usual, it will get to the next level over time. I have no idea how long. It could take much longer than we think. But odds are it will get to that level. I made $600 on a trade on TLRY this past week from getting in at a Fibonacci pull back. And the next move up hit my target perfectly at the extension of the fib. This is just one strategy though. There are others. And it doesn‚Äôt always fulfill. But it USUALLY does.

Your original position has a given delta, a greek that defines how an option's price moves. Delta rises and falls as the stock price moves closer or further from the strike. Here's a fake TSLA FD example:

TSLA is trading at $850, so you scroll to the top of the call list and decide to start with a TSLA $1200C 1/15 for $1 per share. It's got a delta of 0.015 (1.5%) and you don't mind losing $100 to theta gang for some willy wonka and the chocolate factory type thrills.

TSLA moves to $900. The delta means that for every dollar increase, the call goes up $0.015, so for a $50 increase the call is now worth $1.75, right? Not quite, there's another greek at play. Gamma defines how much the delta moves when the price moves, and it's your best friend because it makes this strategy possible. Gamma on this FD is hella low at 0.0003, but TSLA moves literal boatloads so this $50 move it pushes the delta from 0.0015 to 0.003. The option is probably worth about $230 (pricing equations are complex, I'm lazy, have a rough estimate), and you've more than doubled the original $100 investment.

So you sell the call, buy a new one with a 0.0015 delta for $100 and walk away with a new maximum downside risk of profiting $30. TSLA crashes down because the bubble pops, SEC smacks down Elon and delists the stock, your contract is worthless. You have $30 and walk to KFC while all the other TSLA holders wonder wtf happened.",0.46826685219542374,0.034527674706246125,0.07,0.849,0.081,-0.4947

It'll come down to who decides to sell. If the volume is low, it could drive the price considerably as MM grab the shares the had hoped to get cheaper. If volume is high, MM will try to push it lower to grab a good entry. 

There's a lot of big institutional investors in PLTR, they're buying for the long-term and trying to get in at a good price. It may get volatile come lockout ending, but has huge potential 2022 and forward.

&gt; Here's my math. Global TV ad spending is approaching $180b a year. ROKU is currently in 10 percent of streamer homes. COVID has accelerated that money moving from traditional TV to streaming, so ROKU rev topping $15b a year is completely realistic.

9688,PLTR,2021-01-08 16:17:49,"So as i type this out (11am EST) you can sell 5 covered calls on PLTR at a strike of 35$ for 2/5/2021 for 55cents a share premuim. This position is you agreeing you let go of your 500 shares at 35$ a share on that date. You would receive a up front premium of 280$ for that position. In my opinion selling deep OTM calls like this monthly is better than liquidating your share at current value, if it doesnt hit 35$ by then, than you have zero obligation to sell your shares. But if it does, youre having an exit price of 35, not to bad considering thats 6$ above PLTRs all time high.

Assuming it doesnt hit 35, and its now Febuary 6th that contract is gone and your free to sell another 5 covered calls deep out of the money again for march, theres more you can do to mamage that kind of position go check out r/thetagang . 

I personaly put down enough on my place to avoid pmi, but if i had known i could have mitigated the extra fee all together while holding up less captial i would have, in my case i could have gotten in a home a year or so earlier at a cheaper price overall. 

Housing rates are super low right now, the investment value of owning a home in this kind of market isnt necesarily tied to having it paid off but just owning the equity and letting it apreciate. So if you can get in with less upfront cost you can build more wealth putting that extra capital somewhere else, say PLTR stock.",0.42309868875086265,0.11696342305037957,0.022,0.857,0.121,0.9795

Just this past week I FINALLY clawed my way out of my hole. I am up 120% this week alone and am about 10% higher than my starting investment amount.

The funny thing is about 2 weeks ago I hit my all time low and almost pulled out and accepted my losses.

It's crazy what patience will do for you. Of course I could lose it all in a week as well but I've learned a lot since my black friday blunder.

The bull argument is that they developed their own tech, unlike Deloitte and Accenture. Those are both management consulting firms. 

What Pltr jas developed is a platform that basically combines data from many unconnected sources. It allows the user to look at this.combined data, ask it questions and eg look at the state of a car/person/other entity through time. On top of that, it uses machine learning to make those connections faster and more automated. Which makes deployment time short.

 I've been working in data analytics consulting for 5 years. I have not seen anything as advanced and useful as this. This solves the key obstacle that many large companies and governmental bodies encounter on their path to transform data into actionable information.

So yes, they have consultants who implement the software at the client. But the software is really quite unique, so I don't understand the comparison people make with management consulting firms. Deloitte and Accenture don't have this kind of tech nor are they capable of developing it.

Hope this clears things up.",0.5267857142857143,0.31808035714285715,0.032,0.895,0.073,0.7113

Roblox is coming to market soon, I think if you'll be able to get in at the start you could make a pretty penny quickly just like the initial investors for PLTR and all these other companies. They've been operating at a loss though so IDK. Their investor booklet outlines a lot of risk.

It allows the user to look at this.combined data, ask it questions and eg look at the state of a car/person/other entity through time. On top of that, it uses machine learning to make those connections faster and more automated. Which makes deployment time short.

 I've been working in data analytics consulting for 5 years. I have not seen anything as advanced and useful as this. This solves the key obstacle that many large companies and governmental bodies encounter on their path to transform data into actionable information.

So yes, they have consultants who implement the software at the client. But the software is really quite unique, so I don't understand the comparison people make with management consulting firms. Deloitte and Accenture don't have this kind of tech nor are they capable of developing it.

10557,PLTR,2021-01-07 18:48:38,"1. PLTR was founded in 2003 to stop terrorism after 9/11, its logical for the government(CIA) to make a partnership with a startup company that wants to help them, can help them and did help them.
2. PLTR is more like the software company that creates  algorithms that more efficiently can go thru large data sets. It is up to the decision makers (prosecutors, Federal agents) to make the judgements about the data not PLTR, it just helps them find patterns in a lake of data. ""Your data"" is closer to publicly available data that you give companies or make public yourself all the time. You do not have the expectation of privacy in the public domain.
3. Disgruntled employees are the problem makers, that's common sense. Work computers/phones that the company pays for is not private. You just can get away with less nowadays (aka increased efficiency). If you want to communicate privately use your personal phone, problem solved.
4. The oath of office of all officers of the United States states "" defend the Constitution of the United States against **ALL** enemies, foreign and **domestic**;"" . Yes the government defends against domestic enemies that all take an oath to do so. Requires a judge to sign off surveillance on a citizen. (We may agree here on abolishing FISA courts).
5. What goes behind the scenes in politics is scary to the na√Øve. Most ideas are poll tested so rarely say anything unpopular (they tell you what you want to hear). Creating psychological profiles in criminal cases happens all the time, I find that information interesting. I'd pay to see their psychological profile of me.
6. Anything short of treason is politics. Don't you play the game to win?
7. Humans are best for judgement, PLTR just give officials more info/patterns, so indirectly they make the government more powerful, I'm a libertarian I feel your distrust with government. I'm a government employee too, and it reaffirms my skepticism; however, most people are well natured. Don't assume the worst, as long as there are checks and balances. We do have the best court system in the world, but you are not entitled to a perfect court case just a fair one.

Whether you like it or not, more data is the future. Its like being scared of technology, either you adapt or fade away like Blockbuster. Thiel and Karp are philosophical intellectuals, watch all their speeches, they see the big picture. I'd rather them be at the nobs of power than most (other CEOs of tech companies).

PLTR is a necessity, more neutral than ""good/bad' political polarization. The war of the future will be fought and won with Military AI, we have to win or we will get Jack Ma'ed. 

Our society needs our best software engineers giving the decsion makers the info/tools to solving these political problems. Silicon valley 2.0 does not see the overall philosophical picture and long term consequences. PLTR is filling the void and will likely be a material difference of the cyber warfare of the future (due to mutually assured destruction via nukes, we will unlikely have a direct hot war, probably another proxy war like Vietnam or Iraq).

From my perspective, yes they are the good guys, protecting our military and giving them an edge. Democracy and modified capitalism are the fairest political systems in my reasoned opinion and worth protecting. Just look at the wealth and technology our country has produced over the past 125 years. PLTR actually saves lives. Not too many other software companies can creditably make that claim.

Most likely their P/S ratio comes back into alignment with other B2B SAAS companies of \~5 so looking at $1B in rev with \~30% YoY growth and it would be \~4.4B in revenue in 2024 for a valuation of \~22.4B or a drop of 50% from current valuation and down to closer to what it DPO'd at.

huh? no if you sell you don't get to exercise anything...

you only get to collect premiums. think of it like this. You're like the insurance company for the other dude. if you sell a call, you don't get to decide if the other guy exercises or not. You make gains on that premium no matter what. if PLTR hits 30 or more, the other dude gets those exercise those contracts and you say bye bye to your shares. 

However, if it never hits that 30$, in that case, you keep your shares and the premium.

So basically if you make massive gains or not depends really on if PLTR rockets before or after the contracts expire.

The premium are not that great compared to the PLTR (potential) gainz

That's looking similar, to what some boomer stock from years ago did and is now in a book being compared to today's PLTR.

This appears to be nothing more than confirmation bias to me. But I'm a skeptical newtard and don't really know shit. 
Is looking at these TA's really a thing? Do they indicate a following pattern? If so how often are these patterns repeated? How much clout does the average trader give them? How much does a hedge fund give them?

Or is it no more than those colored horoscope scrolls I'd buy as a kid in a gas station?

if you sell it too close, it will reach it and then they will use the contract and you will lose your pltr shares for that strike price a piece.

However, even if the calls are ""in the money"", doesn't mean the other guy is gonna use it cause he ain't necessarily ""making money"", because well, he paid you the premium. And well, if he ain't ""making money"" there's a high chance he won't make that trade. But you know, they might be retarded too so idk.

Set it at a price that you think PLTR won't reach. 

The shorter the time frame the cheaper and the longer the time frame, the more expensive as well, but you gotta hold it longer too, which may or may not be an issue, tho keep in mind, the longer it has been, the more likely PLTR is to rocket as well.

And yeah depending on the strike price the premium for the calls you're selling also changes.

So it'll all depends on how much risk you're willing to take with those PLTR shares. Tho unless PLTR bankrupts, you're not likely to lose money. just that you may miss out on those PLTR gainz. that would suck bad.",0.714611111111111,-0.039833333333333325,0.108,0.807,0.085,-0.7786

This can be done on Robinhood (so long as you are approved for level 3).

Calls are leveraged, so you would be more leveraged than shares...but that also means  to the downside. The art is in hedging properly and unwinding those hedges.

There are ways to calculate potential profits since it's fundamentally like any other spread. It's just up to you to understand and calculate.

I would look up any resource on poor man's covered calls (a specific type of call diagonal).

There's actually not too many resources on it, and I am thinking about creating one in the future. I am currently keeping log of my PLTR diagonal spreads (for over a month now) so I have actual evidence of what to do in each situation, etc.

Either your bitch asses are pulling out of these positions, or it‚Äôs the institutions and trading algorithms that are pushing the market down. So which is it motherfuckers. All this shit depends on how large those candle sticks are.

Someone get some analysis on this and *GME Generals* you get your men in line! We need to figure out if this movement is internal r/WallStreetBets or if it‚Äôs outside boomerfags fucking with our tendies. Motherfuckers in r/Palantards I know your autistic asses are prepping the engines and scooping up this sale!

As a reminder to you all, do your DD and submit a fucking complaint to the SEC regarding BitchFuck Capital and their bitch ass naked puts‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a post that can link here regarding the exact script to follow. Do your fucking jobs and hold the line. PLTR gang is strong. We have seen blood. We will ride the Moon of Demo Day and we shall march through the bloody rivers of lockup expirey into the golden city El Tendos Muy Grandos.

We have tasted victory and we shall prevail. Stand strong! Late January spells our time to buy more stock and February we shall moon again but I tell you, with the boom a bull run comes with it the tired and wither emotions of a **busted** nut they shall come in March. So reposition you‚Äôre portfolios! Only weed, genes, and memes.

**Beware the Ides Ides of March**

I haven't seen any of the trust fund kids chime in, so as someone who grew up rich (sort of) I think I can provide a unique perspective.

TLDR: money can't buy happiness and you can't take it with you

I'm an only child of a single mom who took on a lot of debt to send me to a private school because it was her alma mater. My family doesn't have generational wealth--my grandfather was a humble CPA and back in the 60s private school tuition for my mom was like $75 a semester.

My mom was a struggling freelance writer, so growing up I felt like the poorest kid in a wealthy environment. I'm talking insane wealth. The kids of doctors, lawyers, stock brokers, real estate executives, even the CEOs of companies you've definitely heard of. When Mercedes came out with the G wagon back in 1999 or 2000 or whenever, I remember seeing someone's mom driving one before Busta Rhymes got one because they had some special relationship with the importer.

ANYWAY. When I was in high school something interesting happened: my mom got a huge promotion at the bank she had been working for (as a writer). She became an executive vice president, which came with a generous salary and stock option compensation. By most standards, we were rich. We moved to a new neighborhood in a new city, joined a country club, and she bought us BMWs. I started playing golf and racquetball. If it wasn't Polo or Brooks Brothers, I didn't wear it. I totaled my silver BMW and she bought me a red BMW convertible. Super fucking sweet. 

Being rich gave me an inferiority complex because the kids I grew up with belonged to fancier country clubs, and drove nicer BMWs. It's hard to feel rich by comparison when one friend's dad has a Lamborghini, another friend's dad has a jet, everyone has beach houses and boats, and you don't. I had an allowance in college (I don't remember how much it was, I think it was like $200/month), but my friend had a blank credit card that his parents paid off every month no matter what. I know how fucking absurd it sounds now, but as a teenager those facts waged war on my psyche and left me always wishing I had more. And what I DID have wasn't enough. It also turned me into an absolute asshole, because I saw what the other kids had and fucking craved it, and I resented them for having it. I went to college for finance so that I could work on Wall Street and make ""fuck you"" money. I joined a fraternity and did and said a lot of things that I'm absolutely ashamed to repeat ten years later, because my ego was spiraling out of control.

I always felt fraudulent, like I was just playing a part. Even though my mom and I were comfortably upper middle class, I still felt like the poor kid compared to all of my friends. Wanting to feel rich made me completely ignore all of the gifts I already had. When I graduated college I entered the job market looking for a finance job in the recession. Good fucking luck. I immediately fell into a depression that lasted for three to five years, hard to pinpoint the exact start and end. To pull myself out of it I had to change everything about my life, and I'm still left with an anxiety disorder.

It took a lot for my mom to claw herself out of the debt hole she dug when she was younger. She's going to retire in her 60s this year as a comfortable millionaire, which is great because she was on government assistance when I was born and my dad didn't pay child support, so she's come a long way. But she still has a mortgage and a car payment to make every month. She'll have enough to last her until the age of 95 or so, but she definitely doesn't have ""fuck you"" money. I think SIR_JACK_A_LOT is right in saying that real FU money doesn't start until you hit $10MM. But if my experience has taught me anything, it's that people with $10MM probably think FU money starts at $20MM, people with $20MM probably think it starts at $50MM, and that feeling works its way up the entire chain until you get to Jeff Bezos, who probably just wishes he still had hair.

Out of all the kids I grew up with, I can think of a handful of families who were actually happy then and still are today. A lot of the kids, literally 50-60%, were affected by alcohol and drug abuse as teenagers, alcoholic parents, absentee dads, and divorces. I've watched how wealth has trapped a couple of my friends in lifestyles they don't want. One friend really wanted to be a comedian, but now works for his dad's company. Another friend made furniture and legit dreamed of being a carpenter. He works in finance now. Another friend is one of the sickest singers you've ever heard, but he gave up that dream and works for his dad's company. Some of those families are genuinely lovely people. Some of them are genuinely monstrous.

My mom is a millionaire, but I'm certainly not. She covered my undergrad tuition (aka me partying and skipping class to play golf), but I took out six figures of student loan debt to go to grad school for something I'm actually passionate about. I make about $55k a year as an actor, and my mom doesn't give me financial assistance. I recognize that I benefit from an enormous amount of privilege, however, because I know I have her as a safety net if I ever need it. I've also been able to use her as a co-signer on things to get ridiculously low interest rates. The interesting thing here is even though my salary and lifestyle are certainly middle class, I still feel like I'm a rich kid because of the environment in which I was raised and who my friends are. Growing up in upper class and upper middle class circles was a privilege, because I think I absorbed things that can't be taught, a certain social vocabulary of how to speak, how to dress, how to carry yourself around those kinds of people. It's also because of this that I have unwavering confidence that I'm going to accumulate wealth over the course of my life. It's something I don't even question. Not that I feel entitled to it, but I totally expect it to happen. Thanks to Elon Musk I have a good start.

Writing all of this has been really cathartic, and I wish I could wrap it all up with some sage advice, but I definitely don't have any of the keys to happiness. And that's also not what OP‚Äôs original question was about, though it seems to have developed as a theme in the thread. The things that have helped me have already been touched on in this thread by OP and other people‚Äîchiefly, divorcing myself from the need for material things, and an overall pursuit for meaning and purpose in my life rather than accumulation. Need not, want not, I guess? If anything, I only wish I made more money so that I could give it away and donate it to causes I believe in. That's easy for me to say though; you have to have money and stuff before you can realize it doesn't make you happy. At this stage in life the things that bring me the greatest amount of joy are going hiking and spending time with my friends, and I can‚Äôt do either one as often as I‚Äôd like. 

My friend's dad with the Lambo told me something I've carried with me for the last 10 years: My friend and I were hanging out in his new pool the summer we graduated college, and his dad came out and told us he worked hard his entire life to build that pool, and now he couldn't even use it because he needs surgery and his back is permanently fucked up. He told us to get out there and enjoy being young. It might not sound that profound reading it on Reddit, but the way he said it to us struck a nerve with me. You can't buy back your youth.

That's just my experience, and I'm just one person. I also would love to hear the perspective of some actual trust fund kids. No hate or malice, I would love someone to come out of the woodwork and say ""yeah I get $10k a month from my granddad and it's awesome"" or ""I inherited a family trust and it sucks.""

12633,PLTR,2021-01-06 08:35:56,"It is not just the ML, AI, fancy UI, role-based access to data.

The strength is that they have done a good job of aligning with government - existing contracts, data protection, refusing to work with foreign countries who are not aligned with US policy.  That has a huge value.

The small government departments with $20-30MM contracts don't have the competence to procure effectively, so will be drawn to the existing Gment suppliers because of safety in numbers.  If it is good enough for the three letter agencies, it is good enough for the South Dakota Border Patrol Agency etc.

You raise a valid point - all of IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Northrop and PLTR all have good game.  But the new data analysis kids don't stand a chance on the big, lucrative contracts.  The competitors with the cooler tech (and I am sure there are many) will not stand a chance of winning the big contracts, other than through acquisition or partnerships with one of the majors.  Sensitive data does not align well with consortia of partners either.

The COVID tracking crap has probably helped.  I guess we'll be teased with 2-3 paragraphs in tomorrow's newspaper interview.

Big enterprise also see sucking from the federal tittie as a sign of strength, the government contracts make them a stable supplier.  The next new data analysis startup (and there are many) is great and cool, but will not have the wherewithal to win the big, long term enterprise contacts.  Add an enterprise sales force and it should be easy to outperform the current forecasts.

It does raise a question as to WTF Palantir was doing for the first 12 years of the 17 years though?  Most of the technology developed in those first 12 years must have been through 2 iterations by now.  Hopefully it was turned into experience and intellectual property, rather than a rusty stack of technical debt.

I assume a lot of the first years was spent playing ping-pong and riding scooters around the Bay Area until Mr Pltr made them to grow up and get of the valley.  Hope the grown up data quants are smart enough not to dump all their shares in the first year and to spread their stock sales out.  Anyway, data quants are not famous for being risk takers who immediately cash out and invest it all on coke and hookers.

12717,PLTR,2021-01-06 05:36:18,"That sucks. I'm sorry.

Those LEAPs are going to print for sure. $39.31 break even? Pssh. You'd probably be fine with $49.31. As for now, though, you can sell and try to buy back in at a better price or just hold.

I imagine PLTR to go up after the demo day at the end of the month and then down mid-February when the lockup period ends. If you want to take your chances, you could sell now, buy a call expiring near the beginning of February, and buy back in after another week or two from the call's expiration. Late January is when the earnings call is too, right? After the earnings call, IV (and, correlatively, the value of the option) drops. You could hold until the earnings call and the demo day and then buy back in a week *after* that date when it's theoretically at a lower price. 'Course, I'm not really up-to-date with PLTR news; I've lost too much money on meme stocks to throw cash at them anymore.

That all being said, I'd just hold until expiry. You'll be fine. I know it's hard, and I know it hurts, but that's just how life goes; the difference is that a happy ending is very likely here, and all you have to do is last until January.

Stocks are stressful, man, and once you throw options into the mix it can get overwhelming. Apparently emotions stemming from losses are twice as powerful as gains, too, so if most of your plays are shares and LEAPs then you should just uninstall robinhood and then not even look at it until the end of the year.

Analysts uses data to rate performance.

PLTR uses data to predict the fucking future.

The nature of analyzing, can only be done in past tense. Analysts use what they have to conclude what has happened. They can take a quarterly or yearly report and compare it to another period and determine peformance, but they will never predict the future. That's not the nature of analyzing.

Lets take an example. All the great minds in 1903 straight out rejected the idea of flying. Big US newspapers as well as world wide scientific communities rejected the idea. Then on the fucking 12/17 1903, the Wright brothers had made a vehicle that flew. Everyone had to eat their shit, because their analysis was wrong.

Analyzing data will only get conclusions or comparisons and indicators.

If one sold the 0.85 option and now bought it back at 0.60 the trade would have made 0.25 ($25 per contract).  In that period of time PLTR is actually down $1 per share from when this post was originally written.  The stock is down and the option contract decayed which still made money for the put seller.  It is also suffering from a decline in volatility.

This contract still would not be assigned because it's not at the $22 strike price for the sale price of the short put.

In currently in 12 02/19 BBY 105c as an earnings play.  Their chart is beat down to hell and I foolishly thought a 20% sell-off from their ATH was an over reaction.  Doesn't really move though.  Also in several 02/19 CRM 230c, same situation.

Have 3000 shares of RKT I sell covered calls on and honestly this is the smartest play for me.  I sell them 50 cents out of the money 2 weeks out at a time.  Making $500 a week since this thing doesn't move either.

Last Friday I scooped 10 PLTR 24c for this week as a total gamble.  I never believed in PLTR or their valuation but just thought it would pop, again just a gamble.

AMZN made $10,000 for me last week, but have since dumped about 5 of that since on bad plays.

Need to just slow down and wait this out.  Some tickers are definitely doing well this past 8 weeks, but a lot are just sideways.

The good news is PLTR is quite popular so volume is quite high and should be able to get assigned in or close to the listed price. 

The bad news all PLTR tend to have a high IV - Implied Volatility.  The way anyone really makes a killing with options is when you place a bet in a contract with low IV and then the IV starts to pick up. At the same time if the IV is high and then drops regardless whether the price of the stock goes up or down you will bleed out and lose money.  Ex; many people trade options on earnings if you place your bet 3-4 weeks prior to earnings the IV on these contracts will start to build the closer you get to earnings day.  However if you purchase the option the day prior to earnings the IV mill most likely be at it‚Äôs highest level.  After the co reports you could still make money if they report good numbers (calls) however the IV will most likely start dipping and the option won‚Äôt move as much anymore (sometimes lose money on the call even if the stock pumps).  Other times say you placed a put and the company announces some unexpected good news creating volatility in the stock snd options (even if you are shorting the stock) this newly found volatility can make your put go up in price even if you took the other side of the bet (it‚Äôs a bit counterintuitive) however if you take anything out of my comments it‚Äôs the following; with options (calls / puts) the price of the underlined stock is secondary the primary driver of option appreciation is VOLATILITY - IV (each contract has their IV listed in the contract details).  

Now to answer your question; personally I wouldn‚Äôt play with PLTR until the IV‚Äôs go down more however it‚Äôs your money.  If your mind it made up (and not knowing your budget) I would start my search on the 02/19 contract sequence and would probably select the $23C 02-19.  Yes it‚Äôs more expensive but the chances of making money and not blowing up are far greater..

Also pay attention to the THETA; 

01/08: 23C Theta = 0.1075 - Since expiration is around the corner it has a higher theta approx $10 per contract (the price you pay just to hold it overnight) at $110 that‚Äôs almost 10% of the face value you are paying everyday. 

02/19: 23C Theta = 0.0345 - here since you are paying for addition time it‚Äôs cheaper approx $3 per day (remember the theta keep constantly changing depending on your expiration and the price of of the stock in relation to your break even) 

Cheap Options tend to be cheap for a reason.  Good luck.",0.4769052324487107,0.15993130058347452,0.025,0.915,0.059,0.9521

Before that I was in riot and did wonderful there as well. WSB burned me at the stake tho when I tryed to make a post saying ‚Äúserious there is better plays then GME and PLTR rn but w/e. I feel so bad for people who jump into investing and just find this sub right away. Every once in a while someone post a good bet but it‚Äôs getting progressively worse and none even post bets anymore. It‚Äôs just a echo chamber retards donating to who every is raking it in from GME rn (it‚Äôs not the üíéüëãs here.

Diagonals are typically long vega, and even though I got in on PLTR near the top and historical volatility and IV have fallen to the lowest it's seen since DPO, I am near breakeven on the position (even though I am also long delta) because the vega and theta exposure help offset losses.

I would say FA is arguably worse right now when everything is so detached from fundamentals more so than ever. Also, it works better for long term trading but I'm talking mainly short term here cuz I only trade short term. If fair value is $xx, how long is it gonna take to get to that price if ever? My style is quick bets for big moves with stop losses instead of buy and hold.

If the market was completely efficient then yes, TA would be unnecessary and FA would be king but it's not, especially in the short term. There are ups and downs for seemingly no reason with no changes to fundamentals. There are better companies valued lower than worse companies and vice versa. Fair value is different across sectors, etc. I would rather not mess with all that and trade based off technicals and the rules I set using them but to each their own lol",0.5670634920634922,0.22616843033509695,0.117,0.692,0.192,0.9624

Don't care about fundamentals at all either since I usually don't hold anything more than 3 days max. There are certain trades where I go in thinking I'll hold for a week or two but that's a different type of trading than my usual strat.

For a simple example, let's say I'm looking to pick up calls for PLTR tomorrow if it hits 23 then bounces cuz I have it marked as support. It falls through 23, I don't buy since it didn't bounce. It bounces and trade goes my way, great. It bounces but falls shortly after, I stop out. It doesn't quite get there and bounces, then I might just enter since it bounced even before getting to support or I may not since it's not one of the scenarios for entry. 

It doesn't matter what kind of news came out that day since by the time we retails get the news, it's old news anyway. You can just trade purely on technicals and react faster lol like I said before, it helps me set entries and exits, and helps me base my trading on something with rules, etc.",0.5539285714285713,0.14642857142857144,0.046,0.804,0.149,0.985

but, I was expecting more voodoo AI stuff in the demo. I get the concept of analyst machine interface and their pitch of the operating system of a business. I get that. It's pretty too. 

What I don't get is where the AI comes in. Is the AI basically a bespoke product of Palantir to scour the clients databases and bring it all together?

Or can it also assist the analyst in writing algos to filter and find patterns like a human analyst would? Is that AI bespoke too or is it done from within the client's company?

15660,PLTR,2021-01-04 03:34:09,"Commented this in another post. 

Palantir has a lot of promise moving forward for a couple of reasons. See below.

Sales team:

Essentially Palantir in the 17 years of existence, only has had a sales team for 1.5 years. The reasoning behind this is because internally, Palantir did not want to go the whole sales route of software but recently, that they needed to if they ever wanted to go public and thus reward their share holders. Since the sales team is so new, one can say that they are essentially a new company in that they are in the early years of growth. Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly.

Efficiency / Apollo:

Palantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It‚Äôs an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send ‚Äúforward deployed engineers‚Äù to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&amp;D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir‚Äôs CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir‚Äôs employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers.

Palantir Modules:

On the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it‚Äôs way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir‚Äôs software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.

Final thoughts.

Palantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team. Just be patient.",0.5184329925393754,0.13079423413465968,0.015,0.861,0.124,0.9963

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre confident that a company that has never received FDA approval for a drug will complete a 5-10 year long process to get their therapy approved, and then have such a superior product to the other companies, who are far ahead in the approval process, for the same therapy that they take market share... This is also a curative therapy, so being first to market is huge. You obviously have tons of experience investing in pharma companies and understand translational medicine, FDA approval processes, and the immense amount of uncertainty in bringing a drug that works in human CELLS to actual human bodies.

Which makes you even less likely to be a candidate if they didn't use 506b.

ANYWAY, If you had bought when it hit market you'd have made about the same amount of money for most of these offerings no matter the method. Very few were something you would ever have been approached about to invest in them before going public and this would have had to have happened (lit.) years ago.

PLTR works with both of those industries, likely because they are some of the most historically bloated industries in the world. Decades of no bid contracts, anti competition, govt subsidies, and political protections have enabled wasteful spending &amp; gluttonous dividends. These habits protect complacency within hiring and management hierarchies and created a near perfect entry for papa Thiel and Alex Karp.

PLTR is just an enterprise data OS, but they get a bad wrap because of the aforementioned terry hunting and outspoken usage of big data. MSFT &amp; GOOG &amp; AAPL all do similar stuff with data, but they aren't ""mysterious"" systems explicitly linked to profiting from killing terrys. They are simply more understood by the average consumer, and create the illusion of data privacy protections between systems.

I think PLTR is a good platform because at the core it's an efficiency platform. Yes it has fancy tech and software but it seems to do three things very well:

\- simplify the software stack

\- create business intelligence analysts from workforces with low technical skills

\- deploy engineers who enable rapid setup and user onboarding",0.4242063492063493,0.08571428571428572,0.075,0.779,0.146,0.933

Their digital transformation has just kick-started, and with Cohen I can see them make the step in the right direction. They will be tackling the ease of access fairly soon, then they need to build a forum like structure or something that allows customers to share their opinions on new developments and trends. Get participation - it's free publicity for them if it happens on their platform.

And then they need to sort out the delivery. If I order a ps5 I want it in the same fucking afternoon, not in two weeks time, having to pop to a shop and pick it up.

They should team up with doordash or something to make sure if I test it in the shop and say I want it, it's delivered to my house before I get home, or if I'm ordering from home, as fast as a drug guy can deliver his stuff.

I was wondering if you have any thoughts about PLTR and GME, besides what you said. 
I know GME is a huge YOLO, and I don't really believe most of what people are saying, however I truly believe that Ryan Cohen might turn the franchise around. 

Yes, I agree that the business seems to be dying and they are closing alot of unprofitable stores, but I also believe that to be the correct way to go about changing it from a brick and mortar ( hate that phrase) business to a e-commerce / omnichannel. If Ryan is able to create a online pet company that competes with amazone and other huge tycoons I don't really see why he couldn't turnaround Gamestop. It is already a widely known ""brand"" so it should be somewhat easier than creating Chewy. 
RC buying the stock at 16 $ gives me some hope.

For PLTR I don't really know what to think. It seems to be a very long play, but I feel that the involvement of Alex Karp and Peter Thiel gives it a huge market advantage.

I put in $100 to the stock account. Taxes owed: 0.  
I buy PLTR for $100. Taxes owed: 0.  
PLTR goes up to $200. Taxes owed: 0.  
I sell everything. I now have $200 in my stock account. Taxes owed: 0.

Currently. We have no clue if 1. The past luxuries of going everywhere care free will EVER be back in place unti they revamp the world system of travel 2. How advanced these tech companies truly are. 

This pandemic allows tech companies to research and thrive more, while allowing the rest of the world to crumble due to there limited resources. 

Considering Canada pension plan along with many other institutions invested into PLTR I think they are just allowing for a sideways trade for a while until the next big volume up.

Tesla is 700 dollars..... after split ?!?! That‚Äôs nuts. Not even a year ago it was 400-50‚Äù bucks ..... pre split, this is wild

I think more stocks are gonna continue the trajectory of uncommon rise like Tesla. All due to future growth, and people that truly know tech, and truly know Tesla‚Äôs, apples and palantir plans know the future value of these companies. 

I have been saying.

I've experienced how Palantir deals with software partners, they are strategic and focused on building a portfolio across sectors. They are onto something and could be valued higher. I'm thinking on building a long position but it could drop from here (or not) until the next catalyst: effects of the lookout period, Karp's talk, next earnings, or a new high profile contract.

Go watch some YouTube videos or read investopedia or something to learn about stocks/market/options first and don't be tempted to dump your money into something just because you're seeing people post their gain porn. The opportunities will always be there, your job is to learn how to spot them and until you feel confident in doing so. 

Read the sub, read what people post but don't take their word for it, do your own research, see if you feel the same way they do with the information provided. Thats how you'll learn.

1) If I believe PLTR going back up next week, which I do currently because it‚Äôs hitting 30d support then I do nothing and wait the trade out

2) If I believe PLTR is starting flat around then I‚Äôll sell to open a call, whether that‚Äôs at the same strike price 24c for a butterfly or maybe a wider strangle idk yet, would see how Monday opens

3) If I expect to go down, just close the trade for a loss and not worry since the position size was small anyways (2% of total capital). My current STOP condition is 100% of the credit received.

Lockup ends   - 3rd trading day after earnings report for year ending 12/31/2020. 

What this means is the quarter ends on 12/31/20. the official results of that quarter will be reported to the world on 2/11/21 (approximately) .  3 days after that the lockup will end and 13.3 million shares would be able to be sold.  So we looking at 2/16/21?

ICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: 

* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.
* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.

Originally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.

ERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.

This all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.

Like China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So ""foreign adversaries"" aka ""foreign trade partners"" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.

If we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  

Data analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  

*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*

**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.

It's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  

Only now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).

Ultimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help ""Main street"" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.

PLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.

I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn‚Äôt want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we‚Äôve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in‚Äôs by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don‚Äôt let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price.

With WB investing in Kroger and the possibility of them going to more robotic warehousing, AliBabas announcement they were investing more heavily in JIT production, I could see the desire to get in on the next wave of online ordering... 

For instance, Publix in the Southeast invested heavily on in-house JIT forecasting and production management software. They've recently crossed into a grey area of their longstanding tradition of not having a ""members card"" in order to access their sale prices. 

They've added a mobile app card that you can pay with by entering your phone number. Fucking brilliant. Imagine how much data they are able to gather about their customers shopping habits.

That's why I think PSTH will purchase minority stakes in both Publix Supermarkets and PLTR in order to directly compete with Amazon in the fresh grocery delivery market.

What PLTR offers is a quick way to make a Knowledge Graph (KG), filled with data. Which you can then ask questions and interact with visually. Google Search, Wikipedia, Facebook, Uber: they all use a KG to some extent. The power of a KG over traditional tabular datasets (think rows and columns) is that a KG allows you to infer information from the data, which you have not made explicit for yourself. Governmental bodies have been using/developing KG's for a longer period of time, and you can see now that commercial companies see the value in it as well. Just go to Youtube and search for 'Uber Knowledge Graph'. It's relatively dry material, but the Uber vids are short and to the point.

The fact that it is dry material also explains part of the fact that fucknuggets like Jim Cramer don't understand what they do, and what the implied value is of their offering. It's like trying to explain to my parents what a webbrowser is. It's not their fault, they just don't understand.

But people don't need to truly understand. You don't know how a Ferrari is made, but you know it's a gorgeous, fast, Italian, expensive, and - above all - quality car. You don't truly understand, but the story around Ferrari explains it to you in a way. The same applies to Palantir. You see how they support in making sure the vaccination process is a success. You don't know exactly how, but you know they do. At the end of the day it's very simple: data is raw information, pieced together by context. PLTR offers the best way to distill information out of heaps of data.

**TLDR**: look up 'uber knowledge graph' on Youtube to understand what a KG is. Then imagine PLTR lets you do what Uber does themselves, only in 3 weeks, with 10x the amount of data sources.",0.41042230716143757,0.13127090301003344,0.017,0.874,0.108,0.9865

Maybe its valuation had risen to fast but I just saw the pattern. I fucking saw it. A bulge formed in my Netherland and I knew what to do. All of my money was in PLTR. All of it. My purchased wife was so angry. She can't leave but her boyfriend was extra vicious in our communal love sessions. 

Then PLTR rose 10% in a day. I saw it. I fucking felt the belt buckle of my pants break as my account soared. My wife loved me again and even was willing to shed her boyfriend. 

Then it happend. PLTR reached the peak of its consolidation. A monster green cock pounding at the biggest MM sell wall the market has ever seen. I could taste the sweet tendie nectar rolling down from that resistance. The market opened and PLTR clapped $29's cheeks. I gushed in ecstasy. 

Then it happened. The deathly march began. Day after day PLTR pounded my ass into oblivion. Each day I told myself ""Its going to recover. Its the tax man. We will be alright!""

Then New Years Eve happened. The IV finally crushed my spirits. -17% and -99% later I was left with nothing. Nothing but you beautiful mentally challenged monkeys and my tarnished pride.
