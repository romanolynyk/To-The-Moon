Also think they will announce a new factory in q4 or q1 since they just finished major Shanghai expansion plans and are well on track to get berlin and austin under production in 2021.

The likelihood that they'd spring it on us is low"" is not quantifiable. Ultimately the board is beholden to the shareholders, and institutions in charge are looking for long-term corporate growth. MOASS probably is something that makes them chuckle, but the volatility caused by this seems like it would go against long-term corporate stability. 

Back in 2013 or so when TSLA had it's massive earnings beat, they were the most shorted company on NASDAQ. Following a massive share price increase, they finally offered new shares. While GME isn't CapEx intensive like TSLA, at some point it would benefit them to issue new shares. Maybe that issue price is at $40, maybe it's at $50, maybe $32... but likely, they're not going to wait until the price hits $100 where everyone starts to bail. If shareholders bail to capture profits, then GME will have missed the boat to issue shares at great price point.

if i am chairman or CEO GME, with that extra 5 million share, i will sell right away to bolster my cash balance

if they sell 5 million share, then in theory, price should go down, right?

but i have seen in real life when company issues more shares, price stay steady and then it goes up immediately few days later

two recent example i can think of, TSLA and SHOP, TSLA sold at $650ish, i think, and the price hold steady at $650s before it goes up and now it's $800+. this is very recent in their last earnings report in November so you may notice it  
SHOP sold theirs at $700ish around May 8 2020, you can research this one too because I remember I sold my SHOP at $700 thinking new shares will tank the price, but it went up and now it's $1100+

Just a matter of time before CCP forces TSLA to do a “JV” with NIO or another competitor as a condition to doing business in China. Then they’ll appropriate TSLA’s knowhow/IP and use that to compete by flooding market with bargain basement-priced products (since they didn’t have to pump the money into R&amp;D in the first place). Then TSLA and other American companies will be hobbled. We have seen this process play out before. Compare, eg, Gamesa/wind turbines: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/business/energy-environment/chinese-firm-is-charged-in-theft-of-turbine-software.amp.html

To top it off, the VIE structure adds yet another layer of political risk to foreign investors (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=292674). Several years ago, Jack Ma/BABA basically used that structure to transfer Alipay from BABA to another company, without prior shareholder knowledge or approval. SoftBank and Yahoo got pretty pissed about that. https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/221635/alibaba-has-a-new-way-of-explaining-its-controversial-alipay-spinoff/amp/

So, yeah, I hear you, OP, and I’m right there with you.

1086,TSLA,2021-01-15 00:08:24,"I sell a call. I don't cover. The stock price reaches the strike price. I cover. There is no risk of me losing money except if the price of the stock goes down. At which point i can sell. 

I sell a call, I don't cover. The call is really far. REALLY FAR. The stock price moves halfway to the strike, i get spooked. I buy to cover early.

A call goes into the money, it gets exercised, the person does not sell the stock back, they keep it. The price has gone up. 

A call goes into the money, it had ALREADY been covered, it gets exercised, the person sells it, the price goes down.

Multiple people cover before their strike is reached, they all cause the price to go up, this causes more people to have to cover. It's an infinite loop (tsla)

I sell a put, i want to buy but cant because I want to have the money if the put goes into the money, the put is now out of the money by a considerable margin, i now feel safe in buying the stock itself which i believe in (because i sold the put)

The key has to do with the fact that extrinsic value prevents calls from being exercised (because its better to simply sell the option) but people will start covering early leading to spikes in price. The added volatility causes even more extrinsic value to be generated preventing options from being exercised further. The key lies in the fact that people have to cover before anything else really happens.",0.13271604938271608,0.8718,0.041,0.886,0.073

I originally had 1500 shares that I sold quickly for only like a $4500 gain right before the 12/8 presentations and wild jumps and was kicking myself since I should stick with a company I believe in. I know you shouldn't chase missed gains, but those option terms were just too good to pass up. 

My internal conflict is how much to think about the fundamentals vs. thinking about market psychology. Lots of missed opportunity with that and TSLA when I kept thinking that the fundamentals in terms of valuation and revenue made no sense. Ultimately I want to trade in companies I believe in, but am willing to be flexible for fundamentals vs. market psychology. So for example, with ABNB, I outright bought some other shares at $147. Not great, not bad, but I decided that even though it was overpriced compared to say Booking.com, I'd want to have some skin in the game since I think the company has good potential.

Bro they literally lied to you about having a working prototype and then in an official statement never denied or provided any proof towards Citrons claims and then said 'it's cool that we lied because it was a technicality, and technically the vehicle was 'running' when it was gravity pushing it down a hill'.

Next January, sell another $25,000.  TSLA will crash mid-year.

They don't necessarily buy more shares, but they definitely put a higher proportion of $ in. Please correct me if I am wrong here. 

For example let's say your market-cap weighted ETF has 2 equities with the following mkt caps

TSLA - $1

GME - $1

If someone puts $1 into your etf, your etf will turn around and buy $0.5 worth of TSLA and GME.

GME - $8

If someone puts $1 into your etf, your etf will turn around and buy $0.8 worth of GME and $0.2 worth of TSLA.",0.19249999999999998,0.8792,0.022,0.882,0.096

When stock starts to move, longs will buy more shares, which can lead to significant rally for shorts to deal with. Look what happened to TSLA shorts in 2020. They only started with 20% short. Shorts lost $38B in 2020, then lost another $9B so far in 2021.

GME shorts are completely out of their mind. What if this squeeze to $2000 in a month?

You decide to be 🌈🐻 and buy waaaaay (75% OTM) puts on Tesla expiring 2 months from now. Say you get a 20 bagger and your 10k (deposit) position becomes &gt; 200k and you sell the puts. Your net gain is 190k that will be taxed as short term cap gains. Your account is now worth 200k. Couple scenarios:

1. You withdraw the money and spend it on big red dildos, poppers and ladybois all through 2021. Zeroing out your account. Tax man gonna want his tax (prob around 25% so say 40k) in April 2022...ruhroh! You say ""But tax man I spent it all 😫"" he says ""too fucking bad you owe me 40k 🌈🐻"".


2. You continue to trade throughout the year, you have some good trades but more bad ones. By the end of the year you only have 60k in your account. Even though at one time your account was 200k you only owe taxes on your net gain, so 50k.


3. All trades after your 🌈🐻 TSLA trade suck dick and you're not Adriana Chechik, namsayin? You suck at trading and your account ends the year at $8000 and you call it quits. You lost 2k so you can claim this loss on your taxes even though at one point your account was 200k.

You also made 3k selling the put!  So you actually bought those 100 shares at 720 (72k)!  Hell, thats even lower than the 25k it's at right now!  You just made money!

If you look at his post, he basically doesn't have any real reasons to purchase besides it's tech. How do we know he doesn't have ten alts and just posts about tech stocks randomly?

Additionally, this guys DD reaks of pump and dump. ""I told you so"" is as cult mentality as it gets. PLTR really hasn't had the time it needs to report earnings if we're being real. Long plays are really the way to go, if you're trying to speculate and gamble, GME, TSLA, and NIO are all better in the short term meme potential, they're worth doesn't have to be proven, tweets move the price of those stocks like nothing else.

PLTR is going to continue to fuck everyone that isn't diamond hands, frankly. Like what announcement are you betting on happening that will move PLTR up? More contracts? Another countries retirement fund pouring cash in? And don't get all high and mighty because you're not a Boomer, I'm about as plugged into this space as possible and I didn't hear about these guys until after the IPO. This tech is literally all black box, if you went up to the smartest dude working in PLTR and asked him, so exactly how does your tech work? He'd kinda look at you funny and either reply ""frankly I don't really know"" or proceed with a multi-semester lecture on the complexities and nuances of creating AI systems and at the end of it you'd still go ""oh we really don't know"". 

So, frankly, investors don't know what to do with this stupid ass stock. It sounds like the biggest scam ever ""a tech stock that can't explain how it does what it does""; however they have the mfing receipts if you really want proof that they can do the things they say they can do to some capacity. But that's like super technical stuff that I wouldn't really qualify myself to analyze and verify, but I've seen other's analysis off this board and it's enough for me to go all in lmao.

Put yourself in the short's shoes.

Will you really stick around for a share recall at the wrong time for you? Do you think you will wait for RC et al to announce a shitty/unworkable plan and declare your bankruptcy thesis as the winner and continue bagholding your short position?

With the news of Monday, there is no way they can hope for bankruptcy now and  the company is set for a turn around. As a short you'd better make your plan to exit before June (a recall will happen, but perhaps not a big one, but who knows), before there are institutional and fomo retailers piling on.

&amp;#x200B;

As trading by individual investors boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, so has the popularity of online communities where they gather. Platforms including TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram, Facebook and messaging platform Discord have become the new Wall Street trading desks. Individual investors gather to talk about hot stocks like Tesla Inc., TSLA 4.72% boast of gains and commiserate about losses.

&amp;#x200B;

These investors do more than just talk, though. They piggyback on each others’ ideas and trades, helping fuel the momentum that has propelled some companies to triple-digit or bigger gains in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

People fall in love with \[some stocks\] and they get in these echo chambers, where they are all shouting, like, ‘We’re going to buy Tesla forever!’” said Blake Bassett, a 31-year-old delivery driver who began trading several years ago. “People post all day like it’s a football game.”

&amp;#x200B;

And while online discussions among investors aren’t necessarily new—in the late 1990s internet chat rooms dedicated to stocks helped sustain the tech-stock bubble—social media is more widespread than ever before. That, meanwhile, has coincided with an industrywide move to commission-free trading, while most brokerages have made it easier to dabble in risky instruments like options.",0.1320707070707071,0.974,0.03,0.836,0.135

Next play is AMZN. Too risky for calls for me so I bought 20 shares. Currently -400+ from ATH and earnings on February. Probably going to see run up soon.

Gonna also sell soon cause tech earnings are end of this month and im feeling real bearish with TSLAs earnings. Even if all other Tech beats, TSLA will be a catalyst and drop everyone else.",0.05066137566137566,-0.2031,0.085,0.835,0.08

5390,TSLA,2021-01-12 11:22:30,"Car guy here:

There’s several things to unpack about this, and since you obviously have stellar insight on the financials and people involved, let’s talk a little about what’s really important here: the product. 

The Lucid Air is beautiful. The windshield alone will make people want to have one. Although I haven’t seen one in person, I do know of the designer; Derek Jenkins. He’s the guy who brought us the [VW Sirocco Concept](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g18123426/volkswagen-iroc-concept-gallery/) and eventually the [ND Miata](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g15330684/2016-mazda-mx-5-miata-first-drive-review-gallery/). You can see the beginnings of soft, organic shapes stretched over wheels pushed to corners. It will not doubt look beautiful in the real world, with sunshine over the body. I’d gamble that having a background at VW will also bring specific attention to materials inside as well. Napa leather and “natural” materials (exotic wood and alloys) as trim. 

With the batteries being small, yet the car using a lot of them, cost should be a bit better compared to the traditional set up of a single, large cell. I’d imagine this is also a cheat on their efficiency too, since the weight would be kept down. Weight and ballast management is arguably the second most important thing as to how a car performs on the road (wheels and tires being most important). We won’t know for sure though until they boys over at C&amp;D or R&amp;T can test it.

The only real hang-up I see is pricing. $160K is such a small sector of customer in the auto industry. Don’t get me wrong-it’s typical for new companies to sell a “premium” product in the beginning of business; it helps to generate cash for future growth. But a price as high as that will only appeal to a certain customer, and like it or not, you can buy a lot of car from other very well-established companies for money like that. This is where TSLA has an advantage over everyone right now. 

For me? I know the EV thing is popular with investors these days, largely due to the success of Elon’s offering, but there will be several companies try to capitalize on the interest without necessarily focusing on making a good product. I’d be pretty conservative on my initial investment come IPO. If for no other reason than this: it’s hard as Fuck to make a good car. No matter who you hire, what your research is, where you’re at, or what you got, you simply can not plan for what happens in the real world. There’s always going to be some form of happenstance that catches you off guard. I won’t be going hard in the paint with Lucid until they have a far on the street, in the sunshine. There’s simply too much to risk this early in the game.

Scooters are used in all kinds of weather, and experience wear and tear, so after 2-3 years, used scooters have little or no residual value.

Most expensive part is battery, so after 3 years, users have either to buy new battery, or buy new scooter. What in many cases leads to buying new scooter, since it is new and under warranty, so many people just buy cheap brands with taking this in mind. Why buy expensive one, when in 3 years it will be borderline worthless.

Saw someone playing options .. I was like wtf are options? I googled it... sounded like a crazy way to make even more... so fk it why not, uhm I think this stock should go up.. (I thought I had to wait for expiry) to my crazy convenience that worked. Quite a few times. I said ok what’s a put? Let me try. I lost, ah ok so that’s what a put is. Let’s try a few more: —-&gt; fast forward 2 months im at 15k. Wow I’m pretty good at this, what’s this iron condor shit? Wake up, -5k few hours later -15k... holy fk what’s going on?! I emailed the to exercise the others and I came out of the -15k with +400...   Ok so no more iron condors for me. I threw away my soiled shorts and went back and found out what a PDT was. Lol. Ok, I’m addicted now obv. I’m a med school student and disabled vet; I need moneys lol. Went to E*TRADE cycle repeats, before prime day I bought way otm contract for $8.. prime day hits and by 12-2pm it’s gone from 40- (sold at 56 weak hands yes I know) to 70 for that contract. Fk why didn’t i buy moar!!??

Fast forward, paid bills got another PDT, found Webull. Balls too big to walk with I lost it all (except 200) found a way to ride calls and puts at various prices on same stocks etc, back to 3500.. now things get fun.

With I bounced back and forth between 800-3k so my hands got a little weaker and balls a little
Smaller... take profits, but still the issue of I’m not selling at negative 40% ride or die... (worked but usually didn’t) one example 545% return on. Aapl call that netted me $60 lol. Or 2700% on BlackBerry that net me 980.

Now the real cringe.. so as I sat there wondering man I wonder how many calls/puts I played if only stuck to my guns would I have made? (I looked no further than December... shudder) 
10x Tsla 740calls for Jan 15/21 bought at .16 sold for 2.  
4 tsla 900 calls Jan 15/21 bought for 2.15 sold 2.74
20x SPY 372 puts (can’t remember exact date but I have screen shots somewhere in all these memes) bought during uptrend when spy hit 380’and dumped to 360 (should’ve been like 20+k)
From what i do know, the tsla 740’s would have sold for 144-145 each and the 900’s i think wanna say $8-9$?  So y’all can do the math it makes me sick lmao

Hope you all
Feel better now. (Stuck at 1600 on the same one
started - another with 200 now at 600 in 1 week)

People creating accounts with their favorite crÿ-pto project logos as the profile pics, just to spam comments like “buy the dip,” and “hold and buy more,” “they are building partnerships with so many major companies,” and parroting the same bullet points about each crÿ-pto project. It happens every halving cycle.

But NEVER before have I seen a publicly traded stock suddenly have the exact same social media presence as those crÿ-pto projects... until now. Every thread about Tesla is filled with “$1000 coming this week,” “it’s still undervalued,” “it’s more than a car company, holding for grandkids,” and “don’t miss out, still room to triple the price this year.” These are not just r/WallStreetBets comments and posts—they are on every social media platform right now. It’s a mania just like crÿ-pto becomes every cycle.

I've sold about 10k worth of options last 2 months. So i'm up 10k on all the options I've sold. I sell puts and calls. If you sell puts you need cash to back it up, if you sell calls you need stocks to back it up.

If you sell naked calls it means you dont have the shares, which is bad because if TSLA shoots up to like 3k and I'm selling 1k calls i get rekt and I'll have to buy shares at 3k to sell at 1k lol.",0.1111111111111111,0.7888,0.068,0.814,0.118

To preface this story, I am a licensed, fee-only advisor in the USA. I manage roughly $26MM.
I was speaking to a client this morning and he asked if I would have a conversation with his 15 year old son and answer some questions for him and point him in the right direction in terms of his finances. He has apparently got a little lucky on $TSLA lately and made some good money for a 15 year old, (I'm assuming he is using his parents' outside account).
As soon as I got on the phone with him, I noticed an air of superiority. After discussing his ""investment strategy"" with him for a moment he started to tell me he knows more about investing than I ever will. Keep in mind he says he has been ""investing"" for 2 months. Then he hit me with this quote, which I will never forget in my entire life:

You knew when you bought into TSLA or NIO that is actually is a EV company.

2) The worst that can happen is that it goes back to the cost basis of ~$10. 

Well the worst is actually this fund fails, like the several that Klein drove into the dirt. Also, way too many people here are buying into warrants which can actually go to 0. Also isn't it still more likely that CCIV becomes DirectTV and another SPAC fund becomes Lucid?

To me, unless you're hellbent on maximizing profits to the extreme, it's way more prudent to buy in once the talks conclude and it's official that CCIV will become Lucid, not putting that cart before the horse.",0.010535714285714282,-0.8248,0.079,0.872,0.049

It will depend on the price of the stock and volatility, but a quick way to find out a good strike price it will be one with 95% chance of profit. Most platforms give you this computation, in RH it literally says 95.55% chance of profit when selling calls or puts. 

For example for TSLA at its current price today, selling CCs 1 month out (Feb. 12/19) it will be any strike price above 1300. 

Thus: 10 $1370C 02/19 = ~ $8K.
96% chance it will be OTM. 

Tip: Pick strike price with high theta cuz you know theta gang out here.

first, just because your call's strike price is $1000, doesnt mean your call contract wont increase in price as it goes from $800-$1000. if TSLA is at 800 and it reaches 1000 or higher before your call contract expires, you just made a shit ton of money.

second, the closer to the current stock price your call strike price is, the more expensive the call contract will be. most people here cant even afford calls with strikes at the current stock price unless they expire day of or week of, so what they do instead is buy $1000 strike calls which are more affordable but also more risky, as there is a larger chance the call expires worthless without hitting the strike price. of course, if you purchase a $1000 strike call and TSLA moves from 800 to 850, you could still sell and probably make a pretty penny.

you should do a lot more research on options and understand how the strike price and expiration date affects the value of call and put options.",0.052083333333333336,-0.9453,0.135,0.807,0.058

7309,TSLA,2021-01-11 17:29:39,"I legit think we do often underestimate the sheer influence and power we have over the market. There are 1.8 million subscribers to this subreddit, let's take it down to 1.5 million to generous to people with multiple accounts.

Let's now pretend that each of us is investing $1,000. You can argue that number quite a bit, but seeing a lot of the posts on here, I think some users are definitely investing enough to compensate for everyone else. I think it's too low, but it's just as a proof of concept.

Now, that actually means that we're moving around $1.5b throughout the market. With a lot of the meme stocks and our herd mentality, a lot of those are going into the same companies (GME, PLTR, NIO, TSLA, etc). That's a lot of money. And like i said, I think I'm once again underestimating the amount of money we're moving through the market. 

Honestly, we're pretty huge. I think once we realize how much power we have, we'll start being able to intentionally artificially inflate stocks. Take Signal for example. Lord Elon says ""Use Signal"" and a completely different company skyrockets.

It makes sense that eventually we'll be ""infiltrated"". Imagine having a way of getting a bunch of autists over inflate your companies share prices. It's a lot of power.",0.04246031746031746,0.9584,0.03,0.87,0.1

1. Kicking myself for not being in TSLA

2. Buying the 130 2/19 monthlies on dips. They have fairly low premium compared to other dates &amp; strikes

3. Trying to time the phase 2b from South Africa. If good we are going to see a run up to phase 3 as they likely will have the same results. 

4. Selling immediately on news releases. If I’ve learned anything in Biotech it’s that there are a lot of large institutions that ‘sell the news’ by pumping the stock beforehand and selling out to  retail bagholders. 

I do think the stock will eventually trend towards 300$ on momentum after announcement, but I know what to expect from the biotech investment crowd. 

5. Buy the dip after the sell the news event. This company will probably settle around 20-25B market cap. They probably will be the Corona/Flu vaccine provider of the future. Maybe one day they will get RSV to work. Anyway with valuation like they are and news exposure, I think we see 300$ pretty quickly.",0.13726190476190475,0.802,0.017,0.934,0.049

8661,TSLA,2021-01-11 03:35:06,"Personally disagree. I think inflation will be priced in sooner than later. We've seen growth names multiples expand on the back of a weak economy and low interest rates. Large growth names comprise the majority of the indexes, and imo they won't perform very well and we'll see factor rotation into value and out of growth. Big names like AAPL MSFT etc. may not get hit as bad as, say, $ZM $PTON or $TSLA, but I'm of the belief that we see a large rotation into value. And once that inflation becomes a reality, Powell will raise interest rates, and the TINA effect will be no longer as we see money start to pour into bonds once again in the future (not near term, more like 2022+). The fact that long term rates are not only increasing since the GA dem sweep, but *accelerating*, is a cause for worry for names with bloated valuations. The tech bubble popped and the market got crushed while earnings continued to grow, price is not a function of growth rates, it's a function of valuations which are largely dependent on long term rates for those big growth companies.",0.0009398496240601565,0.8649,0.087,0.779,0.135

9240,TSLA,2021-01-10 20:11:52,"P/E: Price to Earnings Ratio (simple ratio which is calculated by dividing the price of a company’s share by their latest earnings) the result is a metric used to evaluate how cheap or expensive a company is trading.  Almost sure you are asking due to TSLA’s crazy 1,743 PE.   Specific to TSLA means each share is trading at 1,743 FUTURE EARNINGS.  Unusual? Yes but other good companies have also traded at that crazy ratio.  

What really matters is whether they are growing at that clip or hopefully faster.  For their next earnings report they are expected to report revenue (top line) of $10.25 Billion and EPS (Earnings Per Share) of $0.97. With tbt current P/E and for the shares not to rubble they would have to beat both numbers.  Even if they just meet expectations it will drop and if they miss it will fall at least 10%-15%.  

However while P/E is an important metric it’s not the holy grail and there are several other metrics which measure the valuation of a company and whether it’s deserved.

GROWTH vs VALUE COMPANIES:

Growth companies like TSLA have a much higher P/E vs Value companies and tend to trade on average 30X - 80X so at 1,700X it’s fucking crazy but the market is expecting a huge upside in the future.  Amazon also traded at a similar multiple several years ago and grew up to it’s expectations. Others just got killed once the market saw they couldn’t keep up with that growth rate.   

Value Companies say JPM they tend to trade at 10x - 25X since their growth is limited but still generate solid profits they tend to give back their investors a part of the annual profits (aka; dividends).  A growth company would never pay dividends as they would use those profits and reinvest them in the business in order to keep growing.  

Inflation / Higher Rates;
If Rates keep increasing that’s very bad for growth companies as the price of money increases and their generated profits wouldn’t be as high and / or their growth could be limited compared as to when borrowing is cheaper.",-0.00046992481203005744,0.9953,0.067,0.722,0.211

Lock in some gains on the TSLA (assuming this position is long term) —at least enough to put 20% down on the house, which should get you just about the best rate possible on a mortgage (or close to it). And that is the most aggressive scenario I could possibly envision. More likely, I would be advising to take more off the table and invest in a broader, more diversified basket of equities. Would selling half of the position give you FOMO? Well you’d still have $950k of Tesla left, which is still an outrageous amount of exposure, and still gives you plenty of upside in the event that Tesla continues kicking ass. And if it doesn’t? You’ll be damn glad you took enough off the table to give you a respectable portfolio outside of the Tesla position. Which, btw, would also have a quite high expected return over the long run.

Your option contract has two parts, extrinsic (time, volatility, etc) and intrinsic value (how close to the money or far into the money it is). Theta decay increases A LOT on weeklies so that will mean it has to move a decent amount for you to make any money. Example: I buy weekly 900 dollar call on TSLA and lets say its for 500 dollars (for sake of the argument). It expires on Friday and its currently at 880. As Friday approaches its extrinsic value (the time portion of the option contract) gets less and less valuable. If by Friday it doesn’t move, I’ll gain no intrinsic value and lose extrinsic value. If it reaches my strike price exactly, I’ll lose the extrinsic value (the premium). If it reaches my strike price before Friday but doesnt surpass it, I still might not make money because of option decay. Idk. Its complicated but essentially you want it to move your way as quickly as possible. If it doesnt youll lose a lot of the extrinsic value fast and even if it moves your way if it doesnt move enough youll still lose. Thing is though, these contracts are cheap enough to take that risk. Because if a stock has a 5%-10% day you get deep ITM and gain A LOT. If by Friday TSLA is at 930, you made 3000 dollars minus the 500 dollar premium you paid (because its 30 dollars past ur strike price). You can make money even if it doesnt pass the strike but it has to occur quickly after u buy the contract (1-2 days after u buy it). Anyways yea.

On Jan 6th, OP technically paid $530 for ""the ability to buy 1900 shares of TSLA at $1000 per share on or before Jan 15th"". This is insanely unlikely to make money because on Jan 6th TSLA was trading at only $760 per share.

Let's look at an example where TSLA hits $1100 per share on Jan 14th. Because OP bought 19 contacts back on Jan 6th, he would be able to buy 1900 shares of TSLA for $1000 per share instead of $1100 per share. If he immediately turned around and sold them, then he would make $190,000.

The problem is, that if TSLA does not reach or exceed OP's bet of $1,000 per share, then his option contract (ability to buy them at $1000 per share on or before Jan 15th) would expire worthless.

What OP did was sell his ability/position/option/19contracts. So, someone else bought that ability from him for $17,000 (the value of the option based on the volatility of the stock and other factors, like how much it had gained already in such as short time).

Look at it one more way - PE currently 1600. To get that PE ratio down to 35 (still super high) they need to have 45 times more profits.

I've been doing it with NIO, bought shares at $54, wrote a $57.50 Jan29th call for $2.50ish, it's gonna get hit but I still make just over 10% profit overall.

The way it can go 'wrong' is the shares fall and you close the calls but then if you write a new one it's got to be a bit lower to actually get much premium and then the share recovers above that and you get exercised so end up with only a small profit or break even.",-0.06424242424242424,0.8854,0.069,0.809,0.122

Ive never set up these charts, but I do watch stock and option prices for pop opportunities based around consumer (retail trader) sentiment and predictions. 

TA based on company financials is actually for boomers, which is why boomers are obsessed with the dot com bubble. In a volatile market, especially ones that feels paradigm shifting and completely disconnected from reality, sentiment trading is the way to go. 

Tesla has had 12 up days in a row, EVERYONE is excited, confident, but nervous AF. Friday afternoon we had a minor pullback and quick recovery. But that's a sign of the shakeyness of the short term price. 

I am confident TSLA will be $1200 by end of year. But it won't go up every day. There will be a retail market panic sell within the next 4 weeks that will CRUSH options. 

If Tesla even trades sideways for two weeks, that will crush options for to IV dying.

This is telling in the first place because electric motors are hard to purposefully make inefficient—electromagnetic fields are susceptible to far fewer external forces than chemical reactions. 

Here are the details:
TSLA = Model 3 75 kWh; NIO = ET7 150 kWh (double capacity)

Range: TSLA = 353mi/568km; NIO = 650mi/1000km (expected)
You don’t need to be an engineer (though I am) to recognize this is justification alone. But let’s go further. 

Power: TSLA = 450 hp; NIO = 650 hp
More power equals bigger motor and requires more capacity to compensate for any loss of range at the expense of bigger motor.

Load: TSLA = 4072lb; NIO = ?? (presumably heavier, but unless it’s much lighter, not important)
Honestly, it’s impressive that they are able to get this much out of the 150 kWh battery compared to Tesla’s usage of a 75 kWh.

How many models does GM make? TSLA? How many vehicles does GM sell? TSLA? Percentage wise GM has a lot less recalls.

Tesla also ranks last on initial quality. 250 problems per 100 vehicles sold. No person I know that bought a Tesla didn't have to take it back. One person I know literally had their roof panel delaminate and peel off like a sardine can on the highway, as I alluded to.

10491,TSLA,2021-01-09 18:57:37," I joined this subreddit early 2018 shortly after I started investing and was searching for advice. Thanks to you autists, this mofo got me on the fast track to options. I nuked my account in the first year of trading by -50%. It. Was. Great. Such a rush. And thank baby Jesus for the March crash because that's when everything turned around. Since then I have rode calls into Valhalla and my account has doubled, even weeds stocks which comprised of 90% of my portfolio in 2018/2019 have been revived (haven't sold, still holding until the shit is green in my state).

But there comes a time in a man's life when he must make a decision. I remember in 2018 it wasn't so bad and gay to be a bear...it was just part of the cycle it seemed. I think the year of the bear is upon us. Michael Burry, from the big short, who got in too early to the shortage of the housing market was eventually right. Granted, he entered the short too soon and he could have saved \~20% by timing it better. I figure he's learned from this and got his timing down much better over the decade. He is short TSLA, he didn't say it when we hit $420 , $1000, post 5:1 split $690...he's chosen to do it now, and since then it has risen nearly +30% more since he first said he is short TSLA. When TSLA falls, I think it is what starts the 'correction' mode on SPY and the rest of the market.

I think the new prez and related c0ngress are worried coming into a market that is at all time highs, for fear that it'll most likely have to crash during their term in power and people might want to blame them. I think they try to crash it with the changing of the guards when J-Pow is replaced with J-Yellen; they'll try to crash it 1st few weeks in office saying that 'it was like this before we got here, blame the orange man' rather than giving it a year or few months into their term.

Conspiracy numbers to do math with:  
(a) Burry Housing Short gain = **489%**  
(b) Since Burry started shorting TSLA = **up by 30%**  
(c) $420.69 reversed = **$960.24**  
(d) Year of the last time the capitol was breached = **1814**  
(e) Papa Elon's Net Worth = **$195B**  
(f) TSLA market cap = **$834B**  
(g) Year Elon became CEO of TSLA &amp; the year Burry's short paid off = **2008**

\*Positions pending\* eyeing $420 puts to March

TL;DR  
Burry is off with the TSLA short as was his housing short. $960.24 is the TSLA top.",0.0829022829022829,0.6783,0.07,0.845,0.085

Tesla doesn't even make $1 billion a year. They are not a $1 trillion company. Would you pay $1 million for a company that profits $1,000 a year? That is the exact math here. 

There are likely 1000s of companies that make way beyond $1 billion (in a quarter not an entire year) and they have nowhere near that kind of valuation. 

GM/Ford combined (just for the last quarter) profited $5 to $6 billion on $70 billion in sales in 3 months. Their combined valuation is $95 billion. 

Tesla squeaked by with $300 million in quarterly profit on $9 billion in sales (likely 125k rich people buying 70k cars). Their valuation is $830 billion. 

$300 million profit (TSLA) vs. $6 billion profit (GM+F).
$9 billion sales (TSLA) vs. $70 billion sales (GM+F).
$1 trillion valuation (TSLA) vs. $90 billion valuation (GM+F).

Something doesn't add up but feel free to go hunt for a company that makes $1,000 profit in a year and offer to buy them out for $1,000,000. That's what is going on with Tesla right now. 

It could be that, ""but, but, but, they'll change the world, everyone will worship Tesla and buy one, and but, but, everything will be Tesla, so the valuation makes sense....cause years from now everything will be Tesla"".

10846,TSLA,2021-01-09 13:03:01,"A liability is... anything you are liable for. If I show up to the Fed with five one dollar bills and say ""Give me a five dollar bill"" the Fed must give me a five dollar bill. Obviously this is not how this plays out, but you get what I mean. 

The money is fiat therefore the value is intrinsic, yes, but it's still a claim on value. If my bank account says ""1,000 USD"" that means the Fed has promised me 1,000 physical USD will be there whenever I want it. 

It's the same issue that led to the removal of the gold peg and started the whole gold peg deal. During the gold rush, banks realized they could issue notes instead of gold. They gave these notes to miners showing that ____ Note was worth ____ ounces of gold. This allowed the banks to ""give out"" more gold than they owned. It's called **Fractional Reserve Banking**. 

FRB lets banks do more, faster... It's akin to trading with margin. You can instantly reuse your cash even though it has not settled. TD Ameritrade or Robinhood spots you the cash so you can go create more tendies sooner rather than later. The faster you can access those sweet sweet TSLA gains, the faster you can make more. Likewise, the more money banks can lend out, the money they can make in return. This is all held in check by the reserve requirements set by the Fed. They try to keep banks from getting leveraged to the tits, but they do it anyways. 

So, the USD is a liability to the Fed because they're on the hook for every dollar (Digital and physical) in the US economy. They must be able to pay out or exchange these notes for the desired note. If China liquidated all of its bond holdings, the Fed is liable to push those dollars out of the unrealized space and into the economy. 

**The Treasury creates the dollars, the Fed gives them life and manages them.**

Bonds are assets to the Fed because they're purchased with dollars. They hold onto these assets and can liquidate or accrue more depending on financial conditions. It's supposed to be a slow and steady policy... Not 4 trillion in 6 months, but that's off topic. The bonds the Fed owns are locked up dollars, which allows them to control the flow of cash. When the Fed buys a bond they don't pay anyone for it, they promise to pay them at maturity. 

Bond yields are a mess. The run isn't just because bonds are down. Bonds have been trending up with stocks for awhile now. Usually the credit and equity (Bond/stock) markets inverse, but not during a bubble. 

So, yes, you have the right idea. Bonds are assets largely due to the fact that the Fed can control them.

Your original position has a given delta, a greek that defines how an option's price moves. Delta rises and falls as the stock price moves closer or further from the strike. Here's a fake TSLA FD example:

TSLA is trading at $850, so you scroll to the top of the call list and decide to start with a TSLA $1200C 1/15 for $1 per share. It's got a delta of 0.015 (1.5%) and you don't mind losing $100 to theta gang for some willy wonka and the chocolate factory type thrills.

TSLA moves to $900. The delta means that for every dollar increase, the call goes up $0.015, so for a $50 increase the call is now worth $1.75, right? Not quite, there's another greek at play. Gamma defines how much the delta moves when the price moves, and it's your best friend because it makes this strategy possible. Gamma on this FD is hella low at 0.0003, but TSLA moves literal boatloads so this $50 move it pushes the delta from 0.0015 to 0.003. The option is probably worth about $230 (pricing equations are complex, I'm lazy, have a rough estimate), and you've more than doubled the original $100 investment.

So you sell the call, buy a new one with a 0.0015 delta for $100 and walk away with a new maximum downside risk of profiting $30. TSLA crashes down because the bubble pops, SEC smacks down Elon and delists the stock, your contract is worthless.

Lets take just the first line:

TSLA = Tesla, 1/8/2021 = the date the contract expires, thats today if Tesla was under $800 this option would have expired worthless, $800 = the price OP gets to buy the 100 Tesla shares.

$4.86 = the price per share OP paid for the option. So OP paid $486 (100 x $4.86)

$67.89 = price per share increase at the time OP took the screenshot.

1 = number of option contracts OP bought

$7,275 = current value of option contact because TSLA was at about $872.75 and OP gets to buy 100 shares at $800. $872.75 - $800 = $72.75 then * 100 = $7,275

$6,789 (profit) = $7,275 (current value) - $486 (what OP paid)

OP bought this call option contract last week (12/31 per another comment) when Tesla was around $700. So OP paid $486 that TSLA would increase over $100 in share price in 1 week or OP would have lost the $486. It went up $170 and OP is eating some delicious tendies tonight.

Many of you really believe TSLA is on the express train to $1K or even $1.5K.  Let me share some interesting numbers as the odds are now now with the bears if at least for a nice and chunky pullback.

Since Jan 1st of 2020 the longest consecutive streak of up days lasted 10 days (April 3rd to the 17th) with a total gain of just over 32% and then followed by 2 consecutive days of loses accumulating to just over 10% 

The current streak is the longest ever with 11  consecutive days of gains and with an approximate gain of just over 26% 

April’s streak was a bit more impressive yet it was also in April in the heels of the March lows and TSLA didn’t have one third of it’s current and stupidly outrageous valuation.

11347,TSLA,2021-01-09 01:47:17,"**Either this is a glitch, or it’s bullshit.**

A 596,086% gain at a spot price of $829.23 would represent an average cost of ~$0.139/share. This is impossible, since TSLA’s split-adjusted all-time low price is $2.996/share. TSLA traded at this price on July 5th, 2010, shortly after its IPO on June 29th of the same year. Even if OP bought TSLA at that price, **that would “only” represent a gain of 27,667.90%**, not the amount quoted by OP and stated in their screenshot.

Additionally, OP’s screenshot—if we assume that the rest of the figures are accurate—reflects a daily percentage gain on the position of 21.04%. The only time TSLA was up this amount of more on either a close-to-intraday or a close-to-close basis while in the vicinity of the spot price of $829.23/share was on February 4th, 2020. However, this date is *before* the 5-for-1 split on August 31st of the same year, meaning that the all-time-low price pre-split was at $14.98/share, further discrediting OP’s claim. **This in turn would represent a maximum possible percentage gain of just 5,535.58%.**

Suppose OP attempts to argue that the cost per share figure is inaccurate—and that TD Ameritrade fucked something up—because they acquired TSLA stock at a lower cost basis per share during private financing rounds. However, it is worth nothing that if OP “bought [their] first share in 2010”, they would not have been able to participate in private funding rounds, since the last equity financing round before TSLA’s IPO—their Series C—was held on May 1st, 2006. Thus, **OP must have acquired the stock after the IPO, subjecting them to the split-adjusted all-time low price of $2.996/share or (more likely) a pre-split price of $14.98/share**, as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. 

Furthermore, OP could not have altered their cost basis per share via reinvested dividends (which would have likely raised rather than lowered their cost basis anyway) because TSLA has never paid a dividend since their IPO.

Finally, if we again assume that the rest of the figures in the screenshot are accurate, and they acquired the shares at an average price/share of $6.95, **this would represent a gain of “only” 11.845.04%** (whether pre- or post-split), not the figure quoted by OP and reflected in the screenshot.

Verdict: fake, due either to an error on the part of TD Ameritrade or the OP.",0.001944444444444445,0.7351,0.057,0.869,0.074

I’d been working for a big aerospace firm for years, had my MS in engineering with a high GPA, and I have a patent in my name. I asked a few questions and told them I wasn’t the right fit for the job. A big part of it though was that my spouse couldn’t move.

The people on the phone seemed fairly smart but not brilliant. Pay didn’t seem particularly good, and they clearly worked too many hours. I detected a bit of “my job is changing the world” type of thinking. At the time it seemed to be great if someone wanted a “for the love” or “making a difference” type of job and wouldn’t mind the hours for just ok pay. 

The TSLA folks weren’t at all the same as the talent level of the google/msft employees I’ve met though. I routinely interview better talent to work under me than the people who contacted me (aerospace/defense), and my current role isn’t in the hot sexy stuff where top aerospace talent wants to be.

In hindsight, a TSLA stock options package would have made just about any misery level as an engineer working there end up being worth the trouble, but you can never really know that going in.

Just playing devil's advocate here but Tesla is more than an EV company (I hated hearing this 12 months ago too).

Add in battery TAM (industrial - for example they sold South Australia a battery farm).

Add in possible 'mobility as a service' TAM, uber/lfyt etc. and all taxis become essentially obsolete if/when autonomous smart cars hit the market.

It's more of a slow ride up to the next shift... I learned early that blue collar jobs in the energy sector were the way to stability in my life. I grew up living between a massive coal burning plant and later, a nuclear power plant in downriver Detroit. Bad air and bad water in the '70s caused sweeping industry changes finally implemented in the late '70s and well into the '80s. Batteries are the future of transportation, but more importantly they're the future of making a more efficient power grid. The future of grid battery energy storage is upon us. Look to other contenders besides Tesla, such as Strata Solar, AES, and NextEra. I'm watching Tesla closely to see any continued advantages it may have over these company's in the clean energy sector. I'm curious to see 2020's numbers.

6%

In 2019, Energy Generation and Storage brought in $1.5 billion, accounting for 6% of Tesla’s revenue. Automotive revenue brought in $20.8 billion, accounting for 85%.

Yes. Doesn't matter, whoever they are they either have the shares or the cash to cover it. If you have 100 shares of something, you, too, can sell a call. You just make up the terms and put it up for sale.

&gt;If TSLA goes up to $980 by next Wednesday, could he offload those 1000c options to another retard for say ~$25/share locking in $3,200 profit?

I mean, you can list your held options for sale at pretty much any price you want, but if you're charging more than the next guy, no one will buy it. The closer to expiry, the less you can charge because the risk is so much higher (less time for the stock to hit the strike)

I've sold a lot of what I bought pre-2014, but here are a few more screenshots of stock I bought way back when. My wife, who studied economics at Harvard, tried to calm me down in 2008 when our 401k got cut in half with the market crash, telling me it was absolutely the time to buy, buy, buy, which we did--sank $20k into a bloody market. I bought AMZN, NFLX, SIRI, GM, F, and a bunch of shit that died (Blockbuster) or was reborn, like GE, with the original stock left to rot. And each year I'd drop another $10k-$15k in the market, watching our 401k bounce back.

Then nibbled and bought 100 shares at $300 in March. Sold that at $700. Then I thought I could time the market (wrong), and made the greatest mistake in my life and shorted it at $800 in the summer. That dumb move cost me $120K. I traded options and chipped away at my loss. Bought the day after ER and added more and exercised some calls til I got to my $500 avg.

12299,TSLA,2021-01-08 19:57:49,"&gt;But most people here aren’t Tesla investors. They’re options traders. We all want to get out before it crashes. No one here is waiting for Tesla to give money back on dividends like a true investor. We’re just playing the options lotto. That’s why fundamentals don’t matter, because they aren’t that important for short and mid length options. Forward PE has nothing to do with it.

I agree that that's the dangerous part. problem is TSLA is in every boomer's portfolio rn.... 

&gt; But, holding long positions with Tesla is risky as hell. 

that depends on for who it is. any real long term TSLA investor wouldn't really sell even if it would crash soon. They're all planning on bag holding for 10 years. they don't really care about ups and downs.

&gt; People that are long Tesla are ignoring the fact that Tesla actually already has competitors in each of it’s markets. Self driving technology has been around. Electric cars have been around. The Tesla battery will probably be obsolete in 10 years. Then what? There then competing with other manufacturers for the next hot thing. 

yes but you're assuming that Tesla won't grow when everyone else will be. rn Tesla has been innovating faster than anyone else. Literally anyone else. And also for other's to ramp up to this amount of EV production it will take a while. Certainly a long while. It's not so easy to ramp up EV production as they make it seem. You have to make a lot of changes to your factories.

On the ML front, Tesla is definitely a leader currently and the only 2 companies I would be worried about are Apple and Google and ok maybe smaller ones like [comma.ai](https://comma.ai) (founder is very smart) and maybe foresight autonomous. 

Intel well let's just say, I wouldn't be surprised if they disappoint me again and again. and well GM, well let's just say I'll be laughing in 10 years.

What would need to happen is something along the lines of  multiple quarters of slowing or stagnate sales. Eventually, the companies performance will be too disconnected from the valuation and there will be a big sell off. TSLA is a silly stock though and has defied common sense many times over. As long as people are willing to buy and hold this, it'll continue to maintain its insane valuation regardless of what actually makes sense. There's a small chance Tesla meets and exceeds every expectation and today's valuation is warranted; I don't believe this will be the case. I think a large majority of Tesla shareholders at this point are either so caught up in the hype that their ignoring the warning signs or they flat out don't know the first thing about how companies are valued. 

Tesla alone has a higher valuation than all the major auto makers combined. There are about 70 million new cars sold each year, Tesla accounts for .5 million of those.

Sell *at least* $10MM. Then you get a 1MM house, an actual Tesla, $6-7MM of non-retarded stocks and index-funds, and $1MM of cash to see if the gay-bears are right.

Selling $2MM is not enough to retire at 39, if your shit goes tits up. I mean, perhaps it is, but when you wanna send your retarded kids to private school, or a decent college, you're going to have to tell them that they inherited their autism from daddy, who retired at 39 for basically no reason, lost their inheritance, and now needs to see if he can get a job at the 7/11, because they're too rich for financial aid, but too poor to actually afford 50k a year for school.

14748,TSLA,2021-01-08 12:06:28,"Core flaw with this logic is not taking into account the difference in the core business model: outsourced production vs vertical integration.

Auto manufacturing has been, to this point, a capital/labor arbitrage game: outsource all of your parts to cheap mfg markets. Aggregate the parts @ cost+ for assembly at giant, bloated, inefficient plants, and sell, for all practical intents and purposes, ABS on wheels and make the profit on the back end via financing and M&amp;R.

EVs blow a hole right through that business model in that they are so expensive to manufacture there isn’t enough volume leverage to make up for the losses baked into the outsourced cost+ model. Add to that the entire EV industry is supply constrained, from raw materials right up, and you have part of the core issue at the heart of the EV race. And this is just the mfg side.

On the sales side, again, EVs are products designed with as few parts as possible that inherently require drastically reduced routine maintenance. If your entire sales model is built on parts margin (again procured at cost+ from a 3rd party OEM) as a manufacturer, and the baked in mark up on service and repairs needed to keep your distribution network happy, cars go from unit margin positive, to loss leaders at best. Think of it like when Sony had to sell PS3s or PS4s (I can’t remember) at unit losses just to build an installed user base and not concede market share to Microsoft. That’s what legacy auto is facing with TSLA. To truly compete, at a unit level, all of their current mfg has to be scrapped and they literally need to build brand new infrastructure. Problem is TSLA, like Amazon, is sucking the market cap right out of the sector. This puts legacy auto in the unenviable position of cannibalizing their own profits (which weren’t that great to begin with and will not be understood/appreciated by the street or shareholders) in order to deploy enough capital to fully commit to a bottoms up pivot.

Compelling competition is on the way for TSLA, but it’s going to come in the form of a startup/heavily capitalized new entrant (see Apple rumor mill). Not from legacy auto manufacturers. 

TL:DR - To effectively pivot to EV mfg for legacy auto will require too much spend in too little time with all of the environmental regs/timelines on the horizon. Any legacy brands that survive will be the ones that snap up promising startups to basically reverse merger into.",0.13129578754578755,0.9709,0.022,0.898,0.08

Here's my case for ICLN: Biden or not, the world is moving towards renewables. Sure it might hurt short term prospects if Biden fails to deliver, but the world is moving towards green energy. 

If Biden wasn't going to become president, would ICLN be worth as much now? No, of course it wouldn't. But that's irrelevant. It'll be worth as much in 10 years no matter what Biden does today, because that's where the money in the world is moving. 

Green energy right now is pretty much the next oil boom. While all the boomers are propping up fossil fuels, the smart money bets on tomorrow's growth, and there is going to be a massive, MASSIVE shift towards renewables. Fossil fuels will all but disappear as renewables  get cheaper, and regulation around fossil fuels tighten.

 Alllllll that oil money? Allll that coal money? Alall that natural gas money? It has to go somewhere. You know where it's going? 

That's right

Green energy

If you're smart and at least some of your portfolio is geared for 10+ years, that part of your portfolio should be balls deep in renewables.

I believe fully in PLTR and am all in. But if I lost all of that money it would not cripple me or be years and years of my time thrown away. It would royally piss me off and I'd feel horrible, but it wouldn't be the end of the world and I could still go about my day to day business and not be worried about money.

Roblox is coming to market soon, I think if you'll be able to get in at the start you could make a pretty penny quickly just like the initial investors for PLTR and all these other companies. They've been operating at a loss though so IDK. Their investor booklet outlines a lot of risk.

Bezos has always regretted that.

- Stock splits really don't do anything for the company fundementally other than make shares cheaper (or to get an index), usually they're just done to appease analysts and fund managers. Bezos hates both of these groups of people (as anyone can tell you from listening to him on an earnings call, remember ""you might want to sit down"" from a couple quarters back when he was explaining how we was going to spend all amzn's revenue on covid-related expenses?) from years of having to fend off ""amzn will never be profitable lmaoooo"" accusations from them.

Whether it's overvalued depends on if you believe on the efficient market hypothesis.  I had no expectations that TSLA would be a 700B company so quickly, but the market sets the value.  I'm just coming along for the ride and tendies.  At some point, I would expect some profit taking, but probably not until after Q4 earnings comes out.  No speculation on how much it'll drop, but I don't think it'll be a big drop like some people expect.  Since TSLA is in the S&amp;P, big institutions are now manipulating its value in their favor.  


As for GME, if an actual short squeeze happens, I can see it going really high given the short amount of shares available for the shorts to cover.  However, the stock would need to go up enough to cause some margin calls or sufficient losses for the shorts to start covering.  Until that happens, no squeeze.  I'd give it something like a 10% probability right now.  If GME has more concrete plans of transforming itself, I'd raise it to 20% as they still need to execute.

Start day trading options and stonks on paper account in TDA think or swim (you can google how to).

TSLA shorts did this South Sea comparison and Tulip comparison at that time. You probably can search online and find those.

Then TSLA continued its move, from $150 to today $4150. I think there is still a few hundred percent upside to come. Then it will stabilize with high yearly earnings.

I studied the South Sea bubble and Tulip bubble. Everything happen for a reason. If you don't fully understand the background, you will look at the $15 to $150 rally and say ""that looks like the South Sea bubble"", then you would miss the 2700% gain from 150 to to 4150.

A monopoly needs high barriers of entry. The EV market does not have high barriers of entry, there are other car manufacturers entering it, notably VW and NIO. 

In addition to that, Tesla is so ridiculously overpriced that they're worth more than every other car manufacturer in the world.  I agree Tesla is going to be a big player in the market, but to the point where they're outselling the competition combined. Tesla works in a very narrow space - Luxury cars with high profit margins. They won't be able to compete on the cheap EVs coming out of China, Japan, and elsewhere. 

And let's imagine a fantasy world where Telsa somehow has a 100% monopoly on the market. Tesla is worth 150% of the next 10 largest car companies combined. That means Tesla will not only need to sell more cars than they are all selling right now, they'll need to sell 50% more than that. 

That's assuming the stock doesn't grow at all for the next 10 years or so. 

That's how fucking retarded Tesla is.

On Monday I bought my first TSLA option!  Tesla was around $730, and with all the analysts saying that it was overpriced, I figured I'd stick with the WSB crew and buy an $800 call for Friday.  No way that hits, right??  Theta started to do its job, and the call started to lose value as Tesla traded pretty flat for the day.

Tuesday, a brand new day!!  Tesla was up from it's close yesterday, so maybe my call will at least get back to what I paid for it.  Market opens and lo and behold, the option is over $2.00!  Oh shit, it's creeping down again and under $2.00.  Oh well, I'll set a limit sell and exit at $2.00.  Cool, it triggered and I made $78!!!

Whew!  Workweek almost over.  Steel options been going up gradually.  Oh yeah, I should go see how much Tesla went down since I sold that option.  Oh..........it's $833.  The option I sold for $200 is worth $2120.  But the WSB people told me that the only way is 💎🤲🏻. I must truly be a Rtard. Is this what manic depression feels like?

This is incorrect, I believe the most recent ER they said that they were profitable, with and without the tax credits.

When did he say that?  When he said the price was too high?  Could he have meant that the actual dollar value to buy a share was too high, and not the valuation of the company? (ie, a stock split?)

[here's a quick link of all the absolute BS their ceo has been spewing that people like me have said is bullshit from the get go](https://elonmusk.today/) but people like you gobble up and call us retarded. Included in there is when he says they will have 500k by end of 2018 (and that people should actually have zero concern about that). An example of this is the cyber truck. Anyone with a fucking brain knew that thing wasn't real and want going to be ready when they said nor look the way they said. Tesla knew this too. Yet they told people all this bullshit and took an interest free loan from stupid people so they could go build a factory for a car that literally can't exist 

Tesla's strategy to avoid accountability for past predictions is to fill the news with so many garbage numbers that it becomes very difficult to find old reports.

The 2016 prediction was in the Q1 earnings call, repeated in the Q2 2017 earnings call and again in the Q2 2018 earnings call, so if you look up the transcripts for those calls, you'll be able to find them. 

If you want it second hand, [here's a 2016 report](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/elon-musk-best-guess-tesla-makes-1-million-cars-in-2020/),  [here's a 2017 report](https://electrek.co/2017/08/03/tesla-model-3-elon-musk-production-reservations/) and [here's a 2018 report](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/elon-musk-hedges-on-tesla-making-1-million-cars-by-2020-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T).

Which of course brings to mind that 10,000 cars per week was the [original goal for Model 3 production out of Fremont in 2019](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459018019254/tsla-10q_20180630.htm)",-0.017105263157894735,0.1606,0.089,0.825,0.085

19161,TSLA,2021-01-06 13:38:48,"EV range is limited by physics; energy density can not come close to that of gasoline. It is even further off from the energy density of diesel. 50 mile batteries are already here, but stacking more batteries in a vehicle doesn't solve the energy density problem.

The issue with energy density is the weight involves a mileage penalty. A rule of thumb is a 2% decrease per 100lbs of vehicle weight.

The energy density issue is further compounded on longer trips:

* In an ICE vehicle, not only do you need to carry less weight for the saem amount of energy, but as you travel you reduce the weight of the vehicle. Using up an 18 gallon tank reduces your vehicle weight by about 120lbs.
* In an EV, the batteries weigh the same whether fully charged or completely flat. The more batteries you cram in, the more weight you have to lug around everywhere.

EVs are currently competitive due to a raft of subsidies and incentives including:

* Sales tax/VAT credits
* Road tax credits
* Registration tax credits
* Purchase price subsidies
* Electricity usage subsidies (including free to use charging stations)

TSLA has a huge lead in EV. Can they maintain a lead? Probably; they have a cult following a bit like Apple. Can they maintain market share/a lead as big as they currently have? Probably not.

And if those subsidies and incentives go away all EVs become far less competitive with ICE vehicles.

If everyone had an EV, electricity prices would skyrocket and EVs would become less competitive purely on a cost per mile basis even with the subsidies included. From an environmental perspective: EVs don't materially reduce the amount of overall emissions, they just create the perception that they do because the emissions are moved out of cities and into the wilderness where the power-stations are. Unless we start building a bunch of new nuclear plants we won't actually realise a net reduction in emissions from EVs.

And even then, we still have to solve the energy density problem which is limited by physics.",0.07529970029970029,0.9772,0.055,0.817,0.128

Look, I was gonna buy Yeezys with GOOG  
and make some extra tendies...  
But I’m only going to get this one chance  
Something’s right, I can feel it.  
(Six minutes, stop trading, you Aut....)  
Just a feeling I’ve got,  
like something’s about to happen,  
but I don’t know what.  
If this means what I think it means,  
then we’re in a bubble, big bubble.  
The market’s as bananas as you say,  
and I’m still taking chances.  
You were just what the Don ordered!  

I’m beginning to feel like a Streetard  
Streetard.  
All my tendies from last month: I discard  
Discard.  
Now who thinks their ARM’s long enough  
to chance stocks?  
They say I see stock hops;  
so call me Rabbot  

But for me to be a true Autist,  
must be in my genes  
I got a laptop in my back pocket  
Robinhood app will go off when I have profit  
Gotta fat cock from that dip stoppin’  
Made a livin and a killin off it  
Ever since JPowell was still in office  
With machines going BRRRRRR into a fat sack  
I am obscene but I’m honest,   
But as rude and indecent as call-bells  
Sellables

You don't really wanna get into a pissing match

And at the exact same time a bee see’s these  
miracle Alphabet stunts while I'm buzzing  
That I'll still be able to make a put  
when things are stable  
Go forth and back with a couple of options  
that leave me with half.  
Only realized it was ironic I had alpha bet  Alphabet after the fact.  
How come I’m not pro?  
All I do is watch F bomb,  
See; my math was just wack.  
Gay bears are having a rough time period,

Everybody want the key  
and the secret to stonk immortality  
like I have got  
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's  
simply rates and useless exuberance  
Everybody loves to root for those new cents  
Hit that Coke, KO, ass destroyed,  
did nothing but shoot for the moon since!  
MBAs get taken to school with these options

It's me, my honesty's brutal  
But it's honestly futile  
if I don't utilize what I do though  
For good at least once in a while  
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this rippin’  stash I sniffle and snoodle  
Enough times 
To maybe to try and help get some people  through tough times.  
But I gotta keep a few cokelines  
just in case 'cause even you unrefined  
SNAPpers are hungry looking at me  
like it's lunchtime.  
I know there was a time where one guy  
Was king of Wall Street Bets,  
but I still cap like I'm on my Palantir Calls grind  
So at lunch time, I eat the plants you combine  
Appear with the teeth color of dimes  
I got too big and here they come trying to  
CRSPR you like that one line  
I snort, say “I'm Back” from the bathroom: U-P  
Hun, when I tried to say I'll take seven nugs  
from Calls; I’m buyin’  
Put 'em all in a line:

You play normal, Zuck’s being normal  
And I just bought a new rail gun from the future  
Just to train and shoot ya like when  
Elon Musk made LA mad

Blingin' like a Chad while they placate E,  
ya know?
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special  
on the cable channel  
So JPow went straight to the radio station  
the very next day  
""Hey, Bears, I'mma kill you""  
Currency coming at you at supersonic speed,  (JPow Dad)  
“Uh, come on Elon here’s a comma,  
you assuming I'm a human  
What I gotta do to get it through to you:  
I'm superhuman  
Innovative and I'm made to borrow  
So that anything I say  
is repo trading off The Street  
and it'll go to you  
Investigating?  
More than ever demonstrating  
How to give a WallStreetBettin' aut-ience  
a feeling like it’s levitating  
Never trading, and I know that the gaybears  
are forever waiting  
For the day that they can say I fell off,  
they'd be celebrating  
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated  
I make quantitative easing,  
Leaves you qualitative wheezing  
Oh, he's on livestream?  
Well, that's what they do  
when the coronavirus makes them use it  
It's not drip drop, or pop, 'cause trickle down  bubbles won’t refuse it  
We rock: bought yachts and docks  
Type in “Losers Sell” and make 'em lose it  
I don't know how to make gains like that.  
I don't know what terms to use.  
Let me know when it occurs to you  
While I'm zipping any one of these purses:  Diverse? Hurts you.  
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you.  
How many purses I gotta purchase to  
Prove that if you were half as iced,  
your shlong might cease being a virgin, dude! GUH!  
School flunkie, pill junky,  
But look at the ALPO-plays the skills brung me  
Full of dog food, but still hungry  
I bully myself 'cause I make me do  
what I put my coins to  
And I'm a million leagues below you,  
ill when I speak in tongues  
But it's still tongue in cheek: GUH *whew*  
I’m sunk so Tesla take the fucking wheel,  
I'm asleep in the front seat.  
Pumping Double-D’s with the Boys,  
still chunky-butt funky  
But in my head there's something I can feel  
tugging and struggling  
Elon fights with da Bears and,  
here's what they want from E:  
They asking E to eliminate  
some of the ICE-y hate  
But if you take into consideration the bitter  
hatred He has  
Then you may be a little patient  
and more sympathetic to the situation  
And understand the diss to the nation  
Buttfuck it, Ford's handing us lemons,  
buy ELONmade then  
But if E can't better the OEMen  
how the fuck is he supposed  
to buy them a stake then?  
Don't mistake him for Satan  
It's a fatal mistake  
if you think he needs to be overseein’  
Or take a vacation to help a Ford  
And make Ford fall on it’s face;  
You can diss-regard   
Be a king? Think hard,  
why make the bling

TSLA is priced high because people believe in the company, want their products, and expect them to turn massive profits while gradually edging into the US automaker market.

TSLA has the attention of young optimistic people, and their competitors haven't given individual retail investors any reason to be excited about Ford, GM, VW, BMW, Dodge, Honda or Toyota. It's only old guard money managers keeping legacy automakers funded. The average Tesla shareholder probably has tens of shares at best.

When the big players can't match a 2012 model S on specs at the same price point, you just know they're out of touch, not taking the electric vehicle sentiment seriously enough, and way behind.

Yes, Tesla has more fit and finish problems according to the literature on hand, but as the new kid on the block, they are also under a lot more scrutiny, and the big automakers have a vested interest in making Tesla look bad.

Also, don't 2nd guess. Don't peak back at a chart later and beat yourself up for paperhandsing... it's already done. You can't go back and change it.

I paper handed TSLA puts last week that if I would have held would have been up almost 1k... sold for 100$ loss. Stupid, but I can't really let myself get down on myself for 'making the wrong decision', at the time i made it because I've seen too many TSLA charts that spiked, traded flat all day and then fucking SPIKED AGAIN; so my thinking at the time was better a 100$ loss then a 500$ loss fuck it. Having that additional information later in the day which showed I would have profited 600-700$ is cool, but I got to remember that I didn't know that was going to fuckin happen, it could have just as easily went the other way and fucked me.

Yes I could pick a long term movement strat that will have a much higher probability of being successful, but the tradeoff is you get a lower return. If you want higher returns and you want them soon(like I do) you will have to take on more risk. 

For example my trade here (the first spread) is risking 8.6k for a potential 55k gain or 639%, if TSLA closes 5.4% lower on Friday than it closed today. So for this to be a good trade the probability of that happening needs to be greater than 1/6.39 or 15%. I think the probability of that happening is 60-70%. Is my estimate right? Maybe not, maybe it’s much lower or higher, and whether your estimates are relatively accurate or not will become clear to you over time. 

The reason I pursue the short term strategy as opposed to the long term one is because I want to make a lot of money quickly. I’m not interested in a 10x return over two years, even if it’s virtually guaranteed.

I thought it was expensive then, considering the number of shares held by PIPE + insiders, so I'm not a buyer at current prices. However, QS does have real tech and it could become a leader in the EV battery space if it's able to realize the full potential of solid state batteries. However, there is still a ton of uncertainty around whether solid state batteries will be cheaper, have greater capacity, and charge faster then the best batteries that TSLA is able to make in 5 years... TSLA has the growth baked-in to their price, but they also have a track record of not only pushing research forward, but devising cheap and efficient manufacturing processes to make batteries and cars at scale. 

QS has the cash to make it work, if it's going to work, so I am wishing them the best and may invest in the future if I am impressed by follow-up results. Even if you can get something like this to work, what we really need to see is that they have developed a consistent process that will work reliably at scale to produce batteries. What they're trying to do is theoretically possible and they have some good talent, so I'm not writing them off, but remain skeptical.",0.24791666666666665,0.9867,0.018,0.823,0.159

&gt;Even if we both agree that they are 4 sectors in one. If you took all 4 of those divisions and broke them into 4 standalone companies, I don't believe the valuation of all 4 as a stand alone company would add to the value Tesla is currently trading at. 

Does this work for any big company? Like if you broke apple into a phone company, a tablet. Company, a watch company, etc I doubt it would get close to their market cap.

Could probably do the same with Microsoft. 

I'm not really a Tesla bull, but I think evaluating by splitting into smaller pieces makes you lose the fact that all of these technologies being bundled into one company has value in itself. 

For consumer products it's the ol apple slogan ""it just works."" For enterprise IT products it's similar to how Microsoft is huge because they sell a product for literally everything and enterprises don't like buying from a new company if they can help it.

In currently in 12 02/19 BBY 105c as an earnings play.  Their chart is beat down to hell and I foolishly thought a 20% sell-off from their ATH was an over reaction.  Doesn't really move though.  Also in several 02/19 CRM 230c, same situation.

Have 3000 shares of RKT I sell covered calls on and honestly this is the smartest play for me.  I sell them 50 cents out of the money 2 weeks out at a time.  Making $500 a week since this thing doesn't move either.

Last Friday I scooped 10 PLTR 24c for this week as a total gamble.  I never believed in PLTR or their valuation but just thought it would pop, again just a gamble.

AMZN made $10,000 for me last week, but have since dumped about 5 of that since on bad plays.

Need to just slow down and wait this out.  Some tickers are definitely doing well this past 8 weeks, but a lot are just sideways.

20575,TSLA,2021-01-05 06:55:15,"Options are leveraged derivatives contracts that people buy and sell on exchanges similarly to stocks. They are used for a whole host of strategies, like hedges. But they have innate value themselves and that’s what 90% of the trades for them are. WSB overwhelmingly uses options. Why? Because a single option contract represents 100 shares. If you think a stock is going to go up, you purchase a “call” contract. This has a strike price and an expiration date. If the stock in question reaches or exceeds the strike price before expiration, it entitles (but doesn’t obligate) the call holder to purchase the stock at that price, even if the stock continues to go up beyond it. If the stock doesn’t reach that price before expiration, the contract expires worthless. The contract will increase in value itself as the underlying stock price rises, but the value will also decrease at the same time due to time decay, which accelerates massively as it approaches expiration. If the stock is mooning, the value increase will outweigh the time value decrease. 

The options contract originates with someone who owns the stock and wants to make money on it. The “sell to open” a call contract and sell it, receiving the premium (the option “price”) for it. Usually they’re hoping for the price to increase but not close enough to actually pass the strike price. If it does, it’s ok. They keep the premium and then sell the stock (if assigned, not all are) for the strike price and keep the gain like in a normal stock sale. If the stock doesn’t reach the strike price, they still keep the premium but don’t have to sell a single share. 

If you want to keep the stock but it’s approaching the strike price and might pass it before expiration, you can always just buy other call options on the market at the same strike and expiration using “buy to close” but depending on the price movement and time left it might end up costing you some money. You can also buy to close when the premium price has decreased and you just want to lock in the profits and write more contracts. 

This is a very basic overview; there are a ton of resources out there covering this stuff. It’s genuinely not that complicated. Covered calls like this are the most basic strategy using options. And in your situation could literally pay you a quarter million every 45 days just because people on WSB want to buy those TSLA options and then sell them when they’re worth more. Most calls don’t actually get executed. 

TL;DR: do you want an extra $2 mil a year in profit? It’s worth it to take a few minutes to learn about covered calls. It’s not exotic. Millions of options contracts are traded daily. It’s the main vehicle for WSB.",0.03577863577863578,0.9921,0.043,0.829,0.128

They would be on the hook to buy shares at $1200, and sell them to the call buyer for $700, but then recoup some money back because they could then buy shres for $800, and sell them for $1,200. Basically the difference in value between 700c and 800c + the premium they paid for the 800c.

The max gain would be how much premium they pocketed from the 700c expiring worthless, plus how much they were then able to sell off the 800c, which will b down like 50-60% at this point. This max gain number is a bit less precise. it would be effected by how close to $700 the stock was on exp day, and IV at the time. Like if the stock dropped to $600, But then a couple days before EXP, it ran to $699 really fast. The 700c would still expire worthless, but the 800c would be boosted by some juicy IV boost.

It is my opinion that the model Y news temporarily papered over the bad deliveries number which is why it was green today. Also note that the nio hype helped Tesla today as well.

When you look at the valuation you have to take into account their technological lead and scaling speed.

The new battery production lines being built alone are worth half their current share price. FSD is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else, it's worth at least a trillion by itself and it's barely factored in if at all. Their energy business is a sleeping behemoth slowly awakening. 

Their software margins, already the highest in their sector, will become insanely high once the robotaxis are launched. The Cybertruck will brutally destroy Ford and GM's profits and will be the strongest brand product since the iPhone. The Semi is about to be built and change the trucking industry. 2 new factories are ramping up to 10x production by 2025 and 2-3 new factories will be announced. Their insurance business is about to expand in China. They are even hiring video game designers and there are indications that they will start their own gaming service or platform if you can read between the lines.

Shorting TSLA is like burning cash unless you're edging a position. 

Either own TSLA or don't touch it. You don't want to profit from a dip, you want to buy the stock if it dips.",0.061907308377896604,0.7559,0.055,0.847,0.098

21429,TSLA,2021-01-04 08:52:53,this whole sub has been making me realize how arbitrary wealth is as an indicator for intelligence/success/etc. Like TSLA was basically meme’d into space and turned a lot of people who made really risky (at the time) decisions from Wendy’s workers into retired-in-their-20’s Tesla owners over the course of a couple months. It makes sense in my head that wealth doesn’t correlate directly with being smart/successful but idk man. I’m trying to trade responsibly with side cash on the wings of some of these meme stocks because I have a dream of dropping like 20-80k into my dad’s checking account and being like “don’t worry about your expenses for the next year or so” because my parents have done so much for me. Even though it’s not likely I’ll make huge gains on anything it feels crazy to know that it could just change overnight. I don’t really consider myself a gambler but seeing people YOLO themselves into being millionaires is so satisfying. Just crazy to know that the wealth I could provide to my parents could be obtained as a result of a seemingly arbitrary decision. This whole sub is just crazy nihilistic and it feels so good to see posts of people rocketing themselves out of poverty over a joke stock.,0.05294117647058825,0.9687,0.082,0.753,0.165

I remember some time ago a video got posted on Reddit of Scientologists and how they emotionally manipulate the people who left them or publicly disagreed with their practices.  Videos of Scientology church reps telling these people how they are “unstable” and “need help” and “aren’t fit for society”

Obviously people were like “oh wow, what horrible tactics. Why would you do this to people who simply disagree with you?”

Fast forward to 2020. 

I make a comment on r/coronavirus about how the average age of death is higher than the US life expectancy, how fat people are the vast majority of premature deaths, and how anyone healthy under 50 has a higher likelihood of dying in a car crash than from covid. 

First it rains downvotes. Then come the comments. 

“You sound unstable”

“You need help man”

“People like you aren’t fit for society”

Yeah, and their buyers don't have to buy TSLA's tax credits either, they can install solar panels, or do other things generate their own. The system will crumble in 2021 with the major shift to EVs. This will hurt TSLA's ability to invest in themselves, and they will keep diluting. Also note the federal tax credits that consumers got for buying an EV have expired, which is part of the reason TSLA is dropping prices. Prior to their expiration, TSLA basically rolled these credits into the price. This will hurt TSLA's margin.

SPY opens $374 and goes up to $376 in the first hour.

Including meme stocks like TSLA and PLTR.

Robinhoods who bought calls at open will act like they’re the next Wolf of Wall Street and mock 🌈🐻s and make wife’s boyfriend jokes like it’s not overplayed.

SPY immediately dumps to $370 on a $2000 stim shot down by senate tweet even though it was obvious.

Robinhoods throw their calls for a loss and starts mass downvoting. It tanks all the way down to $369.07 and flickers into $368.97.

WSBs loads up on puts at this point. Algos buy the dip and this is compounded by 🥭 tweeting “get $2000 stim done meow 😼”

SPY closes $374, completely flat, and theta wins again.

Just buy shares if you lost money last year.

Went all in AAPL / MSFT in Feb 21 (hey, at last a dip..), just before the market crash. The following 3 months were a once in a lifetime experience.
I sold for profit in early June, while I was trapped, ENPH went to $22 and back to $70.

FOMOED into TSLA at $900 after it had multiple +10% days, the moment I bought it dropped like 100+ points in 30sec. Used a stop loss, back to $250 or $2000 was anyone's guess.

Started a position in ENPH at $56, Prescience Point came and I doubled down at $38.

I do believe it will be tough and that most people won’t want to buy them simply because they are Chinese but if Nio continues to put out quality cars and at a competitive price I think people will have no choice but to consider them as an option. Also whether we like it or not China is increasingly looking like they are going to be the super power of the world. Right now their economy is booming for all working classes and people are happy in China right now. In turn this will lead to more spending and the trickle down effect begins. I wish I had more tsla but I believe Nio has more upside in the next couple years which I why I’m heavily invested in them.

This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says ""U, for 'you'"" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, ""we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry.""
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, ""what's wrong my little X'√π3?""

You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $1,100 and realize the options are actually $1500 each. The best you can do is $1,100 TSLA weekly expiring first week of January.

ZM 4DTE OTM earnings lotto ticket followed by continual losses trying to repeat.  

Was buying otm calls two weeks out and selling to close a few days later.  Mentally exhausting and was 🐻 all through april.  Bought calls in February, puts in March and April.  Took me a while to get on the right side of the market but when I did I kept playing with the goal of not losing anything while still having chips on the table for a lotto to hit.... and one finally did.  Then I got sloppy, I finally decided to buy tsla calls, big time.... on Sept 4th, smh.  That hurt.  Lost more on memes and took another swing for the fences on the next Zm earnings, and lost.  Cashed out.  The more I lost the more I realized how lucky I really was that day.  Life changing event. 

Next year: no more lottos, likely selling covered calls, buying leap debit call spreads.    Although after seeing computer brains post maybe joining theta.

Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses.   
Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day.  
My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits.   
Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid?  Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper.

22434,TSLA,2021-01-01 07:43:01,"Some points I want to make on this discussion:

1. TSLA is not necessarily undervalued. You can't really say they're overvalued either. Valuing growth companies are next to impossible. For example, Apple's stock since 2008 (year the iPhone was released) to 2019 has gained over 1200%. If apple stock in 2008 skyrocketed to a fourth of its 2019 price, everyone would have called it crazy. And that's why so many people missed out on apple/amazon for the longest time! And that is literally what is going on with tesla stock right now. Tesla's potential 2030 market cap with vehicle sales + full self driving robotaxi (discarding the fact that tesla will expand its business to TSLA insurance, solarcity etc) is estimated to be valued at 2-10+ Trillion dollars in market cap (look up [ARK invest's research](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/) although this price target was before the 5:1 split). The only difference between apple, amazon and this time is that the with the advent of the internet. Information has been democratized and retail investors have caught onto this undervalued asset early. They can clearly see that TSLA is going to be huge. Do NOT short or buy puts on Tesla. You will only lose money. Tesla shareholders are not your typical investors - they are fanboys, or strong believers... call it what you want. They will never sell their shares until 2030. Also, with the S&amp;P 500 inclusion a multitude of index funds and foreign funds now hold a large position in TSLA. These funds CANNOT sell their shares no matter what. With that being said, I can't honestly see TSLA drop below 550 tbh, especially as they'll exceed their 2020 target of 500k vehicles manufactured/sold.

2. There has been so much disinformation on TSLA. ""The competition is coming"", ""Tesla is losing money"", ""The only reason TSLA made a profit is due to tax credits"", ""Elon Musk is not a good CEO"", ""TSLA doesn't have the technology"", ""Nobody wants an electric car"", ""Tesla vehicles have massive issues"", ""Demand is falling for TSLA""... all of which are insanely misleading and untrue. I suspect a lot of these personalities that come on TV are paid by either big oil or traditional ICE vehicle companies. Yeah. You've basically been brainwashed by TV into straying away from TSLA. Anyone who is read up on TSLA knows not to short this company.

22463,TSLA,2021-01-01 05:13:59,"**long story**

When 2020 began, I had 1k in my Robinhood. Then I hit an AMZN earning lotto for 10k, which prepared me for the pandemic. When corona began, my political cynicism was finally monetized. I hit 100k in Feb. I started telling my family. They started giving me some money to manage.

Then Powell pummeled me back down to 40k. In hindsight I have no idea why I kept shorting. Some businesses were thriving in the new environment. The Federal Reserve pledged unlimited support and buying returned. Sure, the news flow was terrible, but they always are.

I managed to turn my dumbass around and rode FANG / Tesla calls to ATH of 140k in September. 

Then I don't know what happened. Lots of chasing and paperhands. The most devastating one was selling my zoom calls the day before it went 70%. That was like 40k by itself...

I also pussied out and sold everything on election night at bottom after eating 2 months of decline..... then my dumb liberal brain couldn't long anything for a hilariously long time. The part of me that made me in Feb made me lose out on one of the greatest rallies in history.

There was a final hail mary with TSLA S&amp;P inclusion, but I bought too many otm calls and didn't take it when I was up 20k. Ended up making 0 from that TSLA run as my option losses canceled out my shares.

Long story short, I'm finishing the year with a lame balance of 110k. I know it's still way more than I had, but given the amount of capital I had on hand and amount of things that ran.... shoulda just bought SPY on election night....

Also grabbed 20k in student and auto loans along the way. I should probably get a job.

[My top 10 wins and losses](https://imgur.com/a/UQMW1jh)

You can see I didn't do anything worthwhile since September lol.

All of my family accounts made more than the index this year, so that's nice...? I was not able to recreate the February fire for most. Only one account made it to 80% on the year, but that was because he gave me money before Feb lol. 

I also found that it's generally impossible to trade with family money. I get even more paper handsy.

If I learned anything this year, it's that you HAVE to embrace FUD. It's always there. In hindsight millionaire makers are conviction leaps. I looked at TSLA $1000 leaps so many times from Jan to May. Just one woulda been 250k in gains...

Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for reading
