239,BB,2021-01-16 00:27:14,"So the basic on how call options work is as follows; You buy a contract. This contract gives you the right but not obligation to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price from the writer of the contract. The main negative is this contract has an expiration date in which if you don’t exercise it (buy the 100 shares) or sell it to someone else. It expires worthless and you can’t use it anymore. In this example the strike is $15 and the expiry date is Jan 2023.

The max loss from buying calls is 100% of what you bought them for but the max profit is technically unlimited. I strongly believe that by end of 2021 or 2022 BB will have a steady place between $50-$100 based on numerous factors. But always do your DD before buying a stock.

590,BB,2021-01-15 22:05:11,"Here is a shitty explanation.  But honestly Google is your friend.

A share is a thing you buy.  You pay $10 for a share and it goes to $11, you make $1.

An option is something you can buy too.  What is an option you ask?  An option is right to buy 100 shares at a certain price.  So you pay some amount for the right to buy 100 shares anytime before the expiration date for a price you and the option sell agree to. (Why 100 shares, I have no idea -- because someone decided 100 a long time ago is probably the answer).

Let's make an analogy:
Jim sells gas.  And Bob uses gas.  Gas costs $1/gal today.  Bob thinks gas is going to cost more tomorrow and he is going to need a bunch.  So he goes to Jim and says, ""hey, I will pay you $250 if you let me buy 4000 gallons of gas before the end of tomorrow for $5000.""  Jim thinks, man that's cool I get $250 today and $5000 tomorrow; that's 5,250 for 4000 gallons.  That's 1.3125/gal and gas is only worth $1/gal.  Jim says sure and sells Bob the **option** to buy gas before the end of tomorrow at $1.25/gal.  But Bob knows something, Bob knows there is a shortage and gas is going to cost $2/gal tomorrow.  So Bob can turn around and sell the gas for $0.75/gal profit -- $3,000 profit.  Heck, maybe he can even just sell his option to Sal's trucking and never even touch the gas.... But it all depends on the price of gas tomorrow.


Let's use OP as an example.

/u/nippletits666 (OP) looked at the stock yesterday and it was worth $9.  Someone out there in world was offering to sell options that expire today.  The seller was offering to allow OP to buy shares at $10/share (the strike price) as long as OP bought the shares before EOD 1/15 (the expiration date).  This wasn't a very attractive option since BBBY needed to jump 10% for the option contract to make sense.  So the seller priced the option low ($0.05 per share).  Op bought 50 contracts each contracting cost him $5; his total buy gave him the right to buy 5000 shares each for $10; but he had to buy them before the EOD today.

Yesterday, this looked dumb.  Unless you had faith that the market was going to pop BB.  And this morning, the market for BB jumped.  The stock jumped to 11.00 and people thought, shit it might keep going.  And people were scrambling to buy the options to get BB at 10/share.  OP offered to sell his contracts $1.6/share.  And someone thought the stock might reach 11.75 so getting a share for 11.60 was a good deal ($10 to buy the share + 1.60 for the option).  OP got to sell his options for a profit $1.6 - 0.5 = 1.55/share profit * 5000 = $7,750 profit off a $250 bet (not an investment really -- it was a bet).",0.24232142857142858,0.9952,0.051,0.802,0.147

Companies like TopCon (Tractors/Combines), Rexroth (Mobile Equipment), IFM (Industrial), ect. are way ahead of the game here with this tech and have been doing it a lot longer. BB says they have 63% of the market on EV's? How many companies actually make EV's? Not many. If I was an automaker I'd be looking to adjacent industries for an already existing tech to use. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is what TESLA did by using the RC controller from Rexroth, which is mainly a mobile hydraulics supplier (i.e. construction equipment).   


TopCon has 15 years in this IoT space and self driving tractors all use this technology. They are also thinking about breaking into the automotive field as well.   


If you're an engineer looking into IoT, you've probably heard of IFM as well. These guys are like the Cadillac of IoT/Touchscreen displays. Incredibly smart engineers work here and all their products are made with a focus on data security. I've probably sat down in a dozen or so meetings with various companies about IoT. Most are generic bland dashboards and use the same hardware. So from an OEM standpoint, how do I choose which one to use? Well who has the most value-add in this space, in terms of cooperation/engineering support for integrating their tech into our equipment? IFM is leagues above these other companies in this instance. Most of the companies out there treat IoT like it's a side hustle but it's going to be huge going forward no doubt.   


Tldr; BB will probably get squeezed out of this space like they did in the phone industry because major players are ahead of the game compared to them. Partnered with AWS? Oh boy! Better watch out!

They sold their phone patents to Huawei to fully dive into software and security (cash gang is cool).

Where as when reversed it's no longer profit and you're either bag holding or taking a big loss.

You're last point is exactly why I'm not getting back into GME and if I do it will be much smaller than it previously was.

That is also why I was saying BB seems like a better opportunity. If I hit a loss with BB it most likely wont be as big as GME if it happens. Its still an undervalued price point with several catalyst that occured this week that people are picking up on.

I appreciate you taking the time to write what you've said and it makes a lot of sense. I think I may have just mis-explained what I intended previously, as I think we seem to agree on at least half of what you've written.

Also look into opportunity zone investments.  These are way to maximize your take home of capital gainz.  They are (gasp) real estate investments that require ten year holds, but you kind of get to say FU to the tax man on those gainz.  The richest people I know are selling stocks they don't need to sell to get capital gainz because their CPA is telling them it is too good to pass up.

&amp;#x200B;

I am pretty sure you can buy into a fund for this, but I am pretty sure the fund managers take a big take and don't know a lot about them.  Do your research.  Otherwise, find someone in your town doing these projects.

4949,BB,2021-01-15 13:21:50,"that's a very unprofitable way of thinking.

It doesn't matter where you got in. Say you have GME positions netting you X profit when the price is at $40. If the price goes at $30, you just lost 25%. It doesn't matter what your original amount was. If you have reaason to believe there is more upside in, say, BB, then you should take your GME money and put it there, and instead of losing 25% of your GME money, you might gain another 25% over what you gained with GME (note that I'm *not* saying BB is more profitable than GME right now, mind you, it's just a hypothetical scenario made for argument's sake).

Your way of thinking effectively makes you sloppier  when you are in a profitable position. On average if will make your wins smaller, because you start being less rational about what you do when you're in the green.

A better way of thinking about any position you hold is to ask yourself whether you'd open that position *now*. If the answer is no, then you should close the position you have, because presumably you think there are better places to put your money. If the answer is yes, then you should hold the position. And note that this is what you should ask yourself *regardless of whether the position is currently in the green or the red*.

For a stock like GME, since there are structural factors that justify this bull run (see GME DD on this sub), most people here are buying shares and holding them for the long term and I'm no different. My honest recommendation for you is to throw your $200 at GME while the short squeeze is happening. BB will grow over time but every share purchased in GME accelerates the price where we need it. When you've made a fortune from GME I would double-back and throw your profits into BB.

What you end with most of the time? A product that has a hole somewhere in the underlying OS that no one is good enough to notice and patch.

IOT Cameras with open telnet ports, IOT bondage devices that get hacked and peoples genitals literally held hostage by hackers ( google it lol ), it’s crap.

What QNX offers - from what I gather, I’m far from in the loop on car tech - is an OS they can build off of that is secure instead of an app they slap together.

Tuesday was pretty flat for me. Wednesday GME sent me to the heavens with 1/15 30’s I was holding since September and some April 30’s I bought last week. Cashed out some of those gains and bought FD’s for GRWG, added to BJ’s positions and more GME calls. 

Today was just unbelievable - Bought some BYND calls expiring Feb around 10 this morning. Still riding the GME train. Blindly bought BB calls for Feb  right after selling the GRWG for 300% gains around 12:45.  

Also my baby BJ finally broke 40. I have over 50% of my portfolio in this bitch after yesterday and today’s gains from it.

8775,BB,2021-01-14 21:52:34,"it's a call, not a put.

you're buying a contract to purchase 100 shares of $BB for $14/share on or before 2/19. So if it goes over $14, you make money. Let's say it's $15, you exercise the option and buy those 100 shares for $14, so you're automatically up $100.

What happens more often though is that people buy and sell just the contracts without necessarily exercising them. So like I buy a contract for 1/15 9c and I pay $0.27/share ($27 total price for the contract), then the stock goes up and suddenly the ability to buy shares at $9/ea becomes more desirable so the price goes up and now that same contract is worth $0.54/share, or $54. 

so to somebody who has the capital to exercise it, they see that the stock price is currently $9.60/share, which would be $960/100 shares, or they can buy my contract for $54 and buy 100 shares for $9 per the contract = total price for them comes to $954.",0.14444444444444446,0.9488,0.008,0.876,0.116

Held when I should have sold, sold when I should have held, etc. I got burned pretty early on this week by ICLN calls, so I was skittish and accepted baby gains on everything instead of giving them more time, so I’m down overall because of that. Learned my lesson, so hoping to do better next week and god damn these paper hands.

I even had some GME 1/15 30c for $11 each, watched them drop to $5, then went up to $14 yesterday morning, so I sold. Then the position mooned and is now worth $1000+ each. I left so much money on the table this week it’s not funny. Adding my $BB fail to the mix just adds insult to injury.

It's obvious that BB is a company in transition, the market is trying to value them on their past, not their future. 

The negative connotation of BB's past has continually depressed the SP and limited the growth. Every other OEM/Vendor/Supplier/Partner in the EV Space has been riding hysteric headwinds to the moon when BB is further along in their development process (whether this is justified or not remains to be seen).

10809,BB,2021-01-12 08:05:07,"Excellent write-up.  I second all of this. Couple additional points:

1. The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps.  The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY.  BB will take an app store like commission on revenue.  Billions.
2. After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB's QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.
3. If the automotive biz wasn't enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.

You fucking fools. Buy it, buy as much as you can. Or don't, I don't care, but I am. BB could be 30 by end of year.",0.13115079365079363,0.9627,0.058,0.79,0.152

I'm willing to pay the higher fees for IVDG because I'm betting Invesco assigned a quality team of managers to debut their first ANTs and will want to show there is value here. I have faith in Cathie, but one of the benefits of IVDG should be their ability to make moves based on anticipated shifts without having to tell to the whole world they're doing it, getting them better entries.  May present opportunities to beat Cathie, or do the opposite and make me wish I stayed in something else.

At the end of the day, it's $30k that won't hurt me to lose that I can't pull from the account for 37 years without penalties. If it underperforms, it'll beat SPY. If it over performs, it beats ARKK.

You buy low, sell high. That means on green days you sell puts, on red days you buy calls. LMFAO went from $70 to .70c over 5 years. On friday it popped from 70 cents to 3 dollars+ after hours. All because they released new they were making a spac and lmfa went through the fucking roof, blatant pump and dump. I still rode it since it was 5 min gainers.. I dumped it before AF, 10% gain in 1 hour. I shot up double my price for selling....

I watched as apdn shot up on fda approval for covid uk variant test. bought. 100 shares and took a shit in AH...

I sold BB 7.5 calls 1/8s i had bought on 1/7 i had 2 other strikes for 1/15 sold them for break even because the brokerage they were in is shit and I was afraid they would go to 0 before the day was out (midday shakes)

&amp;#x200B;

$300 is enough to get a taste, buy 10 quantity 30 cent options of some of the big tickers in here with a strike price of 2 weeks or more out... sell as soon as you are scared, you wont make any money until you put the phone down and give it a few hours. holding overnight costs theta, theta runs perpetually at various rates based upon purchasing of the options.... its very complicated, you either buy out of the money at a high strike on a volatile stock, or you buy stocks and have patience.

Now the test is pretty much done, and sellers are dry as my girlfriends cooch. I honestly though the earnings call paired with the prior ivy call was extremely bullish.

If you do a little DD you would see that the market most likely has already priced in a successful trial. They also excepted money from the gates foundation and the US government for the development of the vaccine. Its hard to invision a scenario where nvax is allowed to charge top dollar to any country.

""The funny thing is, depending on the brand of dirt, there *can* be a big difference- though that’s probably not always reflected in the price. Try to study the ingredients list, and see what all is there. Peat moss, composted bark (both coarse and fine), perlite, vermiculite, dairy compost, several different types of fertilizers (some of which are extended release and really cool), dolomitic lime, and occasionally other random additives to get desired effects can all go into it. Also, if you ever see styrofoam bits in your soil, that’s a heads up it’s cheap crap. I should stress here, good companies don’t use styrofoam, they use perlite instead, which, while it looks roughly the same- white bits in the soil; and it does the same job- it, according to her sources, helps break up/aerate the soil, perlite doesn’t have the same environment impact, since perlite is basically volcanic rock ""
