His DD wasn't amazing or new, but it was new to me. I thought it was interesting to see how much of a lifestyle brand NIO is in China. 

The issue I have is definitely with his post history. That strange obscure subreddit he posts in is not only cartoonishly hyper pro-CCP/communism, but also very anti-democracy. He definitely has a hard-on for hardcore communism and posted pics of CCCP flags on a trip to Russia. This is definitely a big part of his life. Can someone have those ideas? Even though 99.99% of us will disagree with them fundamentally, yes, they can have those ideas.

BUT, the reality is, even though WSB is completely retarded, people rely on this sub for their investments (whether they should or shouldn't is practically irrelevant, unfortunately) and put serious amounts of cash into companies based on the ""DD"" in this sub. So, if someone is providing ""DD"" with this massively biased pro-CCP outlook, then I don't really understand how you could suggest it doesn't completely poison the well of what DD is supposed to be.

Most people will agree that NIO is a wonderful company with amazing products. So, is Alibaba. That doesn't change the fact that there are major political risks in investing with them (look @ the Jack Ma situation right now and anti-trust suit lodged against the company - complete BS).

Personally, I wouldn't have banned the user, but maybe assigned him a custom flair that says ""Suspicious"" until he can prove himself as an unbiased, impartial, and constructive member of WSB. If he's just repeatedly pumping nothing but Chinese stocks constantly with a complete gross disregard for the risks of functioning in an economy under the CCP, then yeah, ban him.

Although I feel the banning wasn't 100% justified, I think it's very obvious that this had nothing to do with race, nationality, or xenophobia. Again - we love NIO, the company. William Li is an absolute G. It's disappointing to see the subsequent posts that the banned user has made boiling this down to nothing but racism.

NIO,2021-01-15 12:42,"Feel exactly the same way. I know it’s all about making money, but I can’t help but cringe just a little everytime I see enthusiastic buying for, e.g., NIO. Just a matter of time before CCP forces TSLA to do a “JV” with NIO or another competitor as a condition to doing business in China. Then they’ll appropriate TSLA’s knowhow/IP and use that to compete by flooding market with bargain basement-priced products (since they didn’t have to pump the money into R&amp;D in the first place). Then TSLA and other American companies will be hobbled. We have seen this process play out before. Compare, eg, Gamesa/wind turbines: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/business/energy-environment/chinese-firm-is-charged-in-theft-of-turbine-software.amp.html

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/02/28/1-in-5-companies-say-china-stole-their-ip-within-the-last-year-cnbc.html

To top it off, the VIE structure adds yet another layer of political risk to foreign investors (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=292674). Several years ago, Jack Ma/BABA basically used that structure to transfer Alipay from BABA to another company, without prior shareholder knowledge or approval. SoftBank and Yahoo got pretty pissed about that. https://www.google.com/amp/s/qz.com/221635/alibaba-has-a-new-way-of-explaining-its-controversial-alipay-spinoff/amp/

So, yeah, I hear you, OP, and I’m right there with you. Extra caution is warranted with Chinese companies, and we may be *unfairly* (there’d be nothing wrong if China competed by rules) selling out our longer-term gains and competitive advantage for short-term greed.",0.06306391,0.9742,0.05,0.787,0.163

nio is just one example, but they only sell cars in china right now and it’s more and more every month. they’ve got room to grow into the rest of asia, europe, south america, etc. so they’ve got room to grow and buying shares right now could bring a higher return as they grow their brand.

That link above will display the yearly cars produced. They have started doing double shifts now (and that's got their monthly production to 7000 a month) with weekly being 1750 a month. So the current capacity would be 84 000 cars per year, with greater efficiency and possibly working longer hours they can gain another 30-40% of production over time. Which will put them at 100k cars per month. Furthermore, I read that this current facility can be expanded and JAC was working on that. I fully expect a new factory to be built (looks like they are doing that) to reach a 300k a year run rate for 2022, and China is notoriously quick at building factories. I think they can reach 125-150k with this factory alone utilizing double shifts, longer hours and a factory expansion.

I was annoyed that I sold my PLUG shares on the morning of Jan 11, before it recovered, so I learned a lesson in patience for something that I believed was worth even more.

NIO,2021-01-14 15:47,"I think Lemonade's CEO said the best about legacy companies. There's a lot to think about (a) the people being hired has been there for ages and to think like a startup again to compete in EV space is very challenging. We're talking about software heavy with autonomous, battery, power train, going against Tesla's vertical integration, etc etc. (b) what's the strategy and plan for legacy automakers to exit out of ICE? Just slowly phasing them out? It's like youre trying to catch-up to other's rocket but has so much baggage. (c) legacy companies have investors, boards, dividends to pay out in some case even retirement programs. For ICE automakers, they have dealership to worry about revenue split so all these are considerations especially when you compare their margins against Tesla or other EV new makers.

Lemonade's CEO said when asked why he thinks his traditional insurance competitor wont catch up fast, he says name 5 legacy companies that has successfully pivot totally to catch up with time.

The road to success is incredibly challenging, which is why i think companies like rivian, lucid, chinese ev makers Nio, Li auto, xpeng, etc has a better chance just to start off with a black piece of paper. The counter argument is many will say customer loyalty and years of auto experience. I have a different opinion on that. Again, not that legacy companies can't make it into EV, the question is, in the future are these companies going to be the top EV makers? I dont think so.",0.205204216,0.9791,0.03,0.843,0.127

Apparently I missed my calling as a taxi driver. They absolutely must be rich if that industry is worth trillions.

The stock moved on news that its BUYING HYDROGEN. Not that it's even close to getting hydrogen to work in vehicles.... 

Bro they literally lied to you about having a working prototype and then in an official statement never denied or provided any proof towards Citrons claims and then said 'it's cool that we lied because it was a technicality, and technically the vehicle was 'running' when it was gravity pushing it down a hill'. They literally said that, the CEO bailed out a few weeks later and then their deal to actually make vehicles fell through and now you're hyped on news that they're BUYING HYDROGEN

The only way you woulda made money is if you invested in this company only within the last 30 trading days, any other time before that and you would be down considerably in one of the greatest bull runs in our lifetime, not to mention literally every single meme stock is outperforming NKLA, the dumbest fucking meme stock on existance.

Congrats if ya bought in the last 30 days specifically, but don't be stupid and greedy. Also if you bought at the LOWEST point possible last month and the lowest point possible EVER you'd still be outperformed by every single meme stock....NIO outperformed NKLA by almost triple and that's not even taking NIO at its lowest point that month.

1) People are worried about Tariff and U.S, Chinese relations, as of late we have seen the U.S. (Mostly Mango and congress) isolate specific Chinese companies for either espionage activities or failure to report under American Accounting Regulations for Stocks.

2) NIO is an ADR and you get no voting rights/shares

3) It is still in its growth phase, and while doing well, is trading well above what many would call a reasonable evaluation

4) Many due to politics are on the 'China Bad' bandwagon and since the CCP is pushing NIO they see as attacking the stock as attacking China.

5) The Luckin Coffee debacle soured many on investing with Chinese companies, in fact Chinese companies have a penchant for always 'reporting record numbers'

These factors (there are more) make NIO an especially risky venture for many a traditional investor.",0.089015152,-0.902,0.122,0.82,0.058

NIO,2021-01-13 1:03,"Yeah, while this dude did call it early, anyone can get lucky and pick a ticker, it's not like he even got close to the IPO(I didn't either but that's besides the point). If you look at his post, he basically doesn't have any real reasons to purchase besides it's tech. How do we know he doesn't have ten alts and just posts about tech stocks randomly?

Additionally, this guys DD reaks of pump and dump. ""I told you so"" is as cult mentality as it gets. PLTR really hasn't had the time it needs to report earnings if we're being real. Long plays are really the way to go, if you're trying to speculate and gamble, GME, TSLA, and NIO are all better in the short term meme potential, they're worth doesn't have to be proven, tweets move the price of those stocks like nothing else.

PLTR is going to continue to fuck everyone that isn't diamond hands, frankly. Like what announcement are you betting on happening that will move PLTR up? More contracts? Another countries retirement fund pouring cash in? And don't get all high and mighty because you're not a Boomer, I'm about as plugged into this space as possible and I didn't hear about these guys until after the IPO. This tech is literally all black box, if you went up to the smartest dude working in PLTR and asked him, so exactly how does your tech work? He'd kinda look at you funny and either reply ""frankly I don't really know"" or proceed with a multi-semester lecture on the complexities and nuances of creating AI systems and at the end of it you'd still go ""oh we really don't know"". 

So, frankly, investors don't know what to do with this stupid ass stock. It sounds like the biggest scam ever ""a tech stock that can't explain how it does what it does""; however they have the mfing receipts if you really want proof that they can do the things they say they can do to some capacity. But that's like super technical stuff that I wouldn't really qualify myself to analyze and verify, but I've seen other's analysis off this board and it's enough for me to go all in lmao.

Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO Inc. are an example. The stock has received some of the most enduring interest from individual investors, joining the ranks of dozens of others, including fuel-cell company Plug Power Inc. and Tesla.

\\

Though hardly a household name, NIO is among the most searched stocks on Google. Video snippets under the tag #nio have accumulated more than 35 million views on the social-media platform TikTok, with many young investors encouraging others to buy shares of the company or questioning if it is the next Tesla. And the buzz is alive on Twitter, where it was mentioned nearly 6,800 times on a single day in November, up from about 100 mentions a day at the start of 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

The excitement online has coincided with a rush of trading activity. NIO has been the second-most actively traded stock in the U.S. market over the past year, with about 111 million shares changing hands on average each day, according to Dow Jones Market Data as of Thursday. That only trailed trading in Apple Inc., which has a market valuation more than 20 times that of NIO.

NIO has been a more popular trade than even the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, one of the biggest ETFs tracking the broad stock-market index. Options volume tied to NIO has surged, with more than one-tenth of all activity recently stemming from individual investors, according to Trade Alert data.

Fetching under $4 at the beginning of 2020, NIO’s U.S.-traded American depositary receipts closed at $62.70 Monday, a record. Its market value of about $98 billion is well above that of General Motors Co.

&amp;#x200B;

The chatter has persisted into the new year. NIO was the second-most-traded stock Monday on the retail-trading platform operated by Fidelity Investments Inc., trailing only Tesla. And the trend was mirrored on Webull Financial LLC’s platform last week. Part of the excitement stemmed from the unexpected Democratic Senate wins in Georgia, which some investors believe will give President-elect Joe Biden a greater shot at achieving his clean-energy initiatives.

&amp;#x200B;

The company’s annual “NIO Day” on Saturday, during which the electric-vehicle maker unveiled its fourth production model, had also prompted enthusiasm among individual investors leading up to the event.

&amp;#x200B;

The online buzz has enticed traders to pile in. Gavin Mayo, a 19-year-old student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says he typically spends anywhere from one to five hours a day scrolling TikTok, YouTube and other platforms for ideas on what to trade while churning out video snippets to more than 60,000 of his TikTok followers.",0.10651921,0.9914,0.003,0.896,0.101

Source: Technicals

MACD : Flat on 5 min, 15min, and 30min. Downward trend MACD line coming off highs for the one hour chart, but has not entered bearish territory. 

MVWAP vs. SMA: The indicator is giving mixed signals, but is mostly pointed towards flat in the near term with the indicators crossing alot over the trading day on the 5 minute chart. On the 15 minute it does show that the MVWAP has crossed SMA which is a bearish intermediate term indicator. But on the 30 minute chart the lines have yet to cross and the price has yet to sink to test these level, which still does give us a more bullish stance. 

Volume and RSI looks to be pretty low as well and nothing exciting developing there. The NIO Day hype train was fun while it lasted but we have a lot of people taking profits off the table for the time being. 

So if you ask me, it looks like it will test some support levels at 61, and 59.50, before we start to see another rally behind it. Which makes perfect sense as it would be about a 10-12% retreat from the all time highs. 

So yeah, time to find something else in the meantime.

Good point on Ford and GM.

I’d agree with you regarding the stealth start up, but my fear is the right stealth start up could easily just sell to Tesla for a nice pay day and some of that sweet sweet Tesla stock and factory line knowledge it’s been building up.

My idea of stealth is going to be whomever figures out how to take the RC model car mindset and bring it to real cars.  One or two frames (with modular battery on par with how NIO does it).  Universal spots for motor mounts and all the other techno stuff.  Modular and easy to install shell on top of the frame.

NIO,2021-01-12 11:01,"Yes, Niu scooters are very popular in China and they have a higher quality when compared to competitors. But this comes at a price since their scooters are more expensive than any competition

Scooters are used in all kinds of weather, and experience wear and tear, so after 2-3 years, used scooters have little or no residual value.

Most expensive part is battery, so after 3 years, users have either to buy new battery, or buy new scooter. What in many cases leads to buying new scooter, since it is new and under warranty, so many people just buy cheap brands with taking this in mind. Why buy expensive one, when in 3 years it will be borderline worthless.

Also all ""smart"" features are just a gimmick, that no one really uses, since the main purpose of scooters is transportation.

NIO,2021-01-12 6:09,"I tried to message this to you but wasn’t able to.

A follow on message.  There are 2 things you can do, and its entirely up to you and I’m not going to make recommendations either way.  I just want you to know what options you have.

1) Hold until expiration and hope NIO goes above 66.12.  If it does, you will make some money, possibly a lot because of how many you have open.  The odds of this happening are, the way I look at it, 50/50.  It either doesn’t or it does.  No one is a prophet, I have no idea if it will or not.  If it doesn’t hit your break even you will lose all of your money.  This is the danger of holding to expiration.

2) Sell to Close prior to expiration.  Theta is going to eat the value of the option each day, and NIO has to go up to compensate for this.  The sooner you sell, the more likely you save some capital, but you do run the risk of “leaving money on the table” and having the price spike after you sell it which would have allowed you to break even or make money.

At this point, both are a gamble.  One is significantly more risky: the first.  The reward could be profit.  The loss is your entire life savings.  I am not advising you on what to do, these are simply your options.

I hope this helps.  I hope you don’t lose your life savings, and if you do hold I hope NIO fucking goes to the moon for you for such a risky play.  Again, this is not financial advice, simply some help for a fellow human.

NIO,2021-01-12 5:43,"Alright alright alright.  Here’s the deal.  You paid 6.125 dollars for that contract which is comprised of 100 shares (well, 60 contracts but I’m going to diagnose it in terms of 1). So for every 1 share, you put down 6.12 dollars for the right to buy that bad boy.  Just with mental math, I can tell you that the break even price is going to be 66.12 (60.00 + 6.12 = 66.12).  This is because if you hold to expiration you would need the share to be above that price to make any profit.

Options have two parts that go into its pricing, extrinsic and intrinsic value.  Intrinsic value for ITM (that stands for in the money) options is simply the absolute value of |stock price - strike price|; it is absolute value cause puts and stuff.  Extrinsic value has time (this bad little boy named theta) and value associated with implied volatility.  The Black-Scholes model for option pricing takes all of this insanity and kicks out the option price.  Unfortunately for you, there are fewer days now than when you bought the option and with Nio day past I’m sure the implied volatility dropped as well (I haven’t checked this, it is simply an assumption).  Because of these the extrinsic value has been dropping pretty hard, and theta decay is only accelerating.  To break even on the trade you need that thing to be above 66.12 for you to account for the extrinsic value of the option at the time of buying.

I hope this helps.  I apologize if this comes off as sarcastic, but its hard not to when you played your life savings on something you didn’t fully understand.  Like playing blackjack and not knowing 21 is the number you want with your cards.

I sincerely hope this works out for you.  For anyone reading this; fucking learn how to play options before doing something stupid.  Yolo safe.",-0.085028108,0.9935,0.087,0.689,0.224

1) If you buy now, you're getting in on a company that's like TSLA or NIO from the ground up. 

The difference I see here is that it's not a sure bet and last I heard, CCIV is still bidding for DirectTV. Why not wait until talks are concluded and you're for sure buying into a car company? Do you think it's going from $13 to $100 immediately? What do you actually think is the highest it could hit on the news that wouldn't be worth buying into at that point? You knew when you bought into TSLA or NIO that is actually is a EV company.

2) The worst that can happen is that it goes back to the cost basis of ~$10. 

Well the worst is actually this fund fails, like the several that Klein drove into the dirt. Also, way too many people here are buying into warrants which can actually go to 0. Also isn't it still more likely that CCIV becomes DirectTV and another SPAC fund becomes Lucid?

To me, unless you're hellbent on maximizing profits to the extreme, it's way more prudent to buy in once the talks conclude and it's official that CCIV will become Lucid, not putting that cart before the horse.",0.010535714,-0.8248,0.079,0.872,0.049

NIO,2021-01-12 0:53,"Reminder from another redditor:

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

NIO,2021-01-11 23:50,"Absolutely. It's good to have some sort of plan before entering the position, and the same for exiting.

Let's say you plan to buy 1000 shares of NIO. You wouldn't buy them all at the same time because you can't manage your risk that way and you have no hedge. 

Now buying 100 today and waiting ensures that if it dips you'll be able to add another hundred to halve your cost basis. Rinse and repeat slowly until we trade sideways and you've found the theoretical bottom for that swing trade. 

If it trades up then you're already making money and can add as your risk allows. 

To make some extra cash you can sell some out of the money weekly covered calls (20-25%) while the IV is high and still make some cash while you wait. 

Write down your mistakes! I did that in 2017 and I stopped making the same ones and start making a shit load of money.

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

NIO,2021-01-11 22:05,"People are saying that NIO is over when it will propably only make 2% in a day instead of 10% like at today's opening

If you can't handle a +2% day I don't know what to tell ya except why are you here if you can't stand a day without making a million

I don't regret selling palantir today at the peak to go all in into NIO from 60% to 100%

It might be a bit overpriced already, but with the way EV companies work in today's economy it has lots of room to be even more overvalued like Tesla. I bought shares so I can literally just take 2% profits and run tomorrow at opening but I won't. Nio looks like a very very viable completion to both Tesla and older manufacturers converting to the EV market in the future. Their newest sedan is not something just any company could come up and it shows they have an extremely capable R&amp;D team capable of pushing the boundaries of tech just like it's better known competitors.

 Citi downgrades NIO Inc. to Neutral after unveiling of 'good but not enough' ET7 Citi analyst Jeff Chung downgraded NIO Inc. (NIO) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $68.30, up from $46.40, after the company unveiled its first sedan model, the ET7, at its Nio Day event on January 9. The ET7 is ""good but not enough to make any critical changes from Tesla's challenge,"" said Chung, who estimates that ET7 will only register limited incremental sales of 3,000 to 4,000 units per month from Q1 of 2022, when it is planned to be available. The ET7 may also be challenged by a future facelift of Tesla's (TSLA) model S, while a Model Y price cut chould create head-to-head competition with NIO's EC6, the analyst added.""

If you bought that option and expected to sell after Nio day news, then I would stick with that strategy. If you know of something else in the next week that could be a catalyst for the stock to increase, let me know lol! Other than earnings in March, we're in a bit of a planned news/event drought. Maybe the Norway stuff will come out, with the Nio job openings and that easter egg of the Norway gps map revealing news of faster Europe expansion.

Might not hurt to hold a week, but you'll just be risking theta in hopes that there will be lingering effects from Nio day, which it very well might. Stock price could moon more by the end of the week, or just as easily drop. Safer route would have been to take profit at market open today and never look back at what if you held. 90% is a great return.",0.21780303,0.9727,0.029,0.822,0.149

1. Tesla: we all love Tesla. I see them topping out in the $800-900 range for the next year (knowing Tesla this may come back to bite me). Medium risk, low-ish upside potential
2. NIO: This has the opportunity to be a super high growth stock, also has the potential to crash back to where it started. High risk, very high upside potential
3. ICLN: Bullish because of incoming administration's clean energy agenda. That agenda may well already be partially priced in. Low risk, medium upside

TLDR: ICLN seems to be the lowest risk with a reasonable return - but that's somewhat to be expected since it's an ETF",0.108,0.5106,0.089,0.804,0.107

NIO,2021-01-11 19:12,"Rumor from Bloomberg that **Lucid** Motors is going Public via SPACs. Anyone got in? Usually Rumor from Bloomberg is almost always right.

""Electric vehicle maker [Lucid Motors Inc.](https://origin.www.bloomberg.com/quote/0893204D:US)  is in talks to go public through a merger with one of Michael Klein’s  special purpose acquisition companies, according to people familiar with  the matter.

A transaction could be valued at up to  $15 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the  matter is private. Lucid, which is backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign  wealth fund, is working with financial advisers, the people added. The  talks are ongoing but could still fall apart.

Representatives for Lucid Motors and Klein declined to comment.

Klein, a former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker, has two SPACs that  are on the hunt for deals. Churchill Capital Corp IV -- the largest one,  having raised more than $2 billion billion last year -- is the vehicle  considering a deal with Lucid, some of the people said.

[Churchill Capital Corp IV](https://origin.www.bloomberg.com/quote/CCIV:US) jumped as much as 40% in New York trading Monday. The shares were up 17% to $11:75 at 1:33 p.m.

That SPAC expressed interest in buying a stake in AT&amp;T Inc.’s DirecTV satellite-television business, Bloomberg News [previously reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-05/michael-klein-s-churchill-spac-said-to-eye-at-t-s-directv-stake).  The blank-check company’s talks with DirecTV have since stalled, people  familiar with the matter said. A representative for AT&amp;T declined  to comment.

### SPAC EV Rush

Several  electric vehicle makers have done deals with SPACs as startups seek to  bulk up and raise cash to compete with industry leader [Tesla Inc.](https://origin.www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) Lucid would be one of the most established electric vehicle companies to take this route.

[Faraday &amp; Future Inc.](https://origin.www.bloomberg.com/quote/1368248D:US)  is in talks to merge with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp., people  familiar with the matter said this week, while Nikola Corp. and Fisker  Inc. went public via blank-check deals last year.

Lucid targets the luxury end of the market and its chief  executive officer, Peter Rawlinson, was previously Tesla’s chief  engineer on the Model S sedan. Backers include Public Investment Fund,  Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which has invested more than $1  billion in the company.

The company was founded in 2007 under the  name Atieva and spent years being more focused on battery technology  than pursuing development of a luxury car. It pivoted in 2016, changed  its name to Lucid, and began work on what would become its main model,  the Air.

Lucid plans to start deliveries of a $169,000 electric  sedan to U.S. customers in the second quarter. The Air EV, which the  company says can do more than 500 miles on a single charge, will be  built at a factory in Casa Grande, Arizona. It plans to offer more  affordable versions of the Air from 2022 and later will build a  battery-electric SUV.

NIO,2021-01-11 17:29,"I legit think we do often underestimate the sheer influence and power we have over the market. There are 1.8 million subscribers to this subreddit, let's take it down to 1.5 million to generous to people with multiple accounts.

Let's now pretend that each of us is investing $1,000. You can argue that number quite a bit, but seeing a lot of the posts on here, I think some users are definitely investing enough to compensate for everyone else. I think it's too low, but it's just as a proof of concept.

Now, that actually means that we're moving around $1.5b throughout the market. With a lot of the meme stocks and our herd mentality, a lot of those are going into the same companies (GME, PLTR, NIO, TSLA, etc). That's a lot of money. And like i said, I think I'm once again underestimating the amount of money we're moving through the market. 

Honestly, we're pretty huge. I think once we realize how much power we have, we'll start being able to intentionally artificially inflate stocks. Take Signal for example. Lord Elon says ""Use Signal"" and a completely different company skyrockets.

It makes sense that eventually we'll be ""infiltrated"". Imagine having a way of getting a bunch of autists over inflate your companies share prices. It's a lot of power.",0.042460317,0.9584,0.03,0.87,0.1

The reason China allowed TSLA's to be sold there is because they wanted to move away from relying on fossil fuels and to seem environmentally friendly due to their track record with pollution. Meanwhile they desperately have been trying to make their own EV so they don't have to rely on an American company. I believe they chose NIO as their bet but the technology is just not there.

1.) I’m bullish on the stock in general, their cars look great. Their partnerships seem real. If I’m just looking at their EV’s, they seem legit. 

2.) The “NIO is a lifestyle” shit is deeply concerning, in my opinion. Huge red flag. 

I don’t really buy the whole NIO Dealership/Clubhouse thing. It sounds ridiculous. You’re also a cafe/hangout spot now? You have a clothing line?(not that ridiculous, merch is totally normal especially out of recycled parts, but still) Families are sending their kids to go hang out there...lol? 

Even if it’s not total bullshit, it’s just strange. Maybe it’s a culture clash, I don’t know. LK made these same types of strange claims though. 

*They’re Chinese Starbucks but oh no they also are like Chinese Amazon! “LK rewards creates loyal customers” blah blah blah.* 

I didn’t like comparing LK to NIO until I saw that shill post and it ticked a lot of the same boxes. 

A bunch of people from some town all had NIO’s and got together and booked a full plane to go to NIO day with their pilot who’s also a NIO owner and fan? Right, sure. Totally not paid for by NIO.

If you had an OTM $80 call option on NIO for 1/15/21 you're saying the price will rise from $58 -&gt; $80 by the 1/15 which is unlikely (but not impossible, especially in a bull market) so the option price might be cheaper, with a low delta (closer to 0). But, if NIO rallied to $85 before or by 1/15, those options become a lot more valuable as they are now ITM and NIO has momentum, so the delta would increase and hence the price of the option would as well. Because these options were cheap (because of the close expiry and hence likelihood of NIO raising past $80 being low) you are hypothetically able to buy a lot more and hence profit a lot more. A safer play would be to buy a call option for $80 with a further out expiry (if you believe NIO will eventually surpass $80) but the price of the option will increase with further out expiry dates according to market expectations, so you wouldn't be able to buy as many and hence would profit less.

NIO,2021-01-11 6:13,"From what I understand, if NIO gets past your strike price before/at expiration - you can exercise the option. Ideally, NIO would get past your Break Even (strike price + cost of option) and then your profit = (total cost of options x (current share price - strike price)) - total cost of options. If 1 option cost $2, 1 option contract (100 options) costs $200, so if you bought 10 option contracts ($2,000), NIO rallied to $80, your strike price was $65, then profit = ((80 - 65) x $2,000) - $2,000 = $28,000. 

Options are attractive because they offer leverage with minimal downside. The downside is the cost of the option contracts ($2000 in this case) if the underlying share (NIO) doesn't surpass the strike price of $65. The upside is $28,000, or close to if you decide to sell the calls before expiry (assuming you don't want to exercise the contracts for whatever reasons), which you only risked $2,000 to receive. 

To answer your question specifically, if NIO raised past your strike price the call option would no longer be OTM, it would be ITM and hence profitable. Since delta is basically a measure (between 0 and 1 for a call option) of how much the price of an option changes according to changes in the underlying share (NIO), I assume that the further the option is OTM the closer delta is to 0, and the closer it gets to being or actually being ITM (i.e. NIO approaches or surpasses your strike price) the closer delta is to 1. So your delta is representative of the options value - your option has inherent value when it is ITM, and speculative value when it is OTM if the market decides the outcome of NIO raising past your strike price before expiry is likely.",-0.041176471,0.9343,0.06,0.846,0.094

These are my exact quotes.

&gt; I also dislike their autonomous announcement, camera megapixels are irrelevant. (to autonomous driving)



&gt; It’s no longer true that the higher a camera’s megapixel count the better. (for resolution)

&gt;Resolution isn't tied to megapixels, you can have a 2MP camera that captures in 1080p

NIO having an 8MP to Teslas 2MP is incredibly irrelevant. Improving resolution does nothing past a certain point other than waste resources, the human eye can barely differentiate between 4k and 8k, a computer can deal with 360p easy.

There are Robotaxis in the world right now, Waymo is running their HD mapped Lidar system in geofenced areas. Tesla's FSD is really impressive and is likely orders of magnitude safer than a human. Having said that, the main benefit of FSD is public transport, Robotaxis seem dumb to me while that isn't implemented, how cheap could buses be without a driver? Tesla/Waymo/NIO don't seem to care about it, not even Comma.ai talk about it.

It will likely never be perfect but the demand is there already, people are spending $8k to have it included with their Teslas even though its illegal to use in most scenarios.

But IF in 2022 you can now with a more powerful processor increase the resolution of the cameras while maintaining the speed necessary to process the data, that would in theory be a better system.

I'm willing to bet Tesla will eventually increase camera resolution as and when they feel the software/hardware can process the sensor quick enough.

Elon Musk has a lot of broken promises about Teslas autonomous system. If everything he said came true we would of had robotaxis in 2020. I'm still skeptical if the hardware in Model 3 is able to reach L5 standards. Too many blind spots. Too many missed targets already.

I don't think Nio will be the ones to crack it either. 

It's why I don't really care for any manufactures self-driving software at the moment... I think we're at least a car cycle away for the hardware + software to come together and achieve it...",0.154901961,0.5951,0.083,0.813,0.104

Why pull The rug on NIO when you can pull the plug on JD BABA etc with way bigger market cap and institutional ownership. That would be way bigger fuck you and will actually destroy numerous western institution that owns a lot of stake on these big giants. 

It’s unfair to compare this to what is happening in HK. China never moves on their stance when it comes to  sovereign and dissent. 

But when it’s come to economic. That is literally CCP’s one and only goal. They know their power internally and externally comes from their economy. Fucking with international money like this is literally doom for the CCP.

USA is more likely to fuck over investor in Chinese company by pulling the plug on their end than China doing this. 

Hate the CCP for their action in human rights and Democracy but as an investor you have to understand China is the only country in the world that place economy above literally all else. 

Is this fuckery by CCP possible? Yes. It’s it likely that CCP will do this and kill its economy hold on the world? Think about it carefully and you will realize the answer is a hard no.",-0.05122549,-0.9835,0.126,0.829,0.045

No matter who is in power, if you fuck with the wealth of the upper-middle class and above, the US is not going to have it. This would have to be done after years of build up where US is highly invested in China in this manner, and when the rug is pulled out, it would *have* to be a crippling blow to the US - and possibly every other western power.

NIO,2021-01-10 20:21,"You don't have to hold it until expiration. This is where the greeks come in - basically delta and theta are the important ones.

Theta gets a lot bigger as the expiry date gets closer (especially the last ~2 weeks). Delta gets bigger as you get more ITM.  
  
So to answer your question, you can buy the call now, then if/when the share price goes up to your liking, sell the call before time goes by and you lose money to theta. If you buy 3/19 60C tomorrow with NIO at $59 (it'll probably move by opening, but let's just say it doesn't), then NIO goes to $65 by end of the week, you can sell for a nice profit.

Reminder:

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

NIO,2021-01-10 19:08,"Sold NIO a few weeks ago and haven't looked back. The reason? Because the most recent US bill signed into law talks about an oversight requirement.

China has also been known to allow an Enron or two to be pulled in the past, so no, I will no longer be investing in Chinese stocks until there is a settled consensus on how to handle the regulations the US wants to push.

There is certainly money to be made within the next three years with NIO, but I am not looking to babysit an overvalued stock from China just as I am not interested in babysitting the overpriced Tesla (made my money there as well and then got out).

The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States. 

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty. 

Think Darth Vader to Lando in Cloud City: “I am altering the deal, pray I do not alter it further.” That’s the CCP.",0.051470588,0.9432,0.017,0.895,0.087

NIO,2021-01-10 18:00,"Great post OP. A lot of foreign critics and even Nio investors have no idea what kind of market Nio is in or how good their service is. Just wanted to expand on the service point which is super underrated.

When Nio first started out, They would pay for your trip to their events regardless if you buy their cars or not. When there wasnt enough charging or swapping station, william li made sure your weekend driving or long business driving was covered and send charging van along the way to meet you and charge your vehicles. That is going the extra mile. The first few owners that collect their cars from Nio were all greeted by William Li, the ceo has been there listening to their customers since day one. The community and respect for their customer is why Nio customers are so loyal and the referral is so high.

The other thing that isnt talk about much, their e-commerce side of Nio products is expanding and attracting a lot of consumers outside of their car customer. This is something to watch because Nio is about lifestyle. I wont be surprised they eventually build their e-commerce out to become a large platform itself.

Also, their loyalty program. They never left out their first batch of guinea pig customers. On top of the possibility of upgrading your car's battery for longer distance for the older es 8 version that is no longer in production, you get more discount to buy the new et7. (10000 instead of other nio car owner's 7000) and also more credit points. The older customers are just blown away by how much Nio is still remembering them and at this point they really dont expect anything. You also get the special badge in your account as recognition, etc etc all these little things add up to a huge amazing experience. That is quality service.",0.223685065,0.9883,0.027,0.846,0.127

They sold 5,291 cars last year. 92.67B market cap. Tesla did 500k cars.

How can op gage market when there's just a handful of cars out there? This is likely a pump/marketing post since op has no history.

Battery swap does not scale. The stations and attendants are expensive and process 1 car at a time.

Most models are pretty ugly.

Rich people choose foreign brands for status. Driving Nio will not get you a pretty wife at the correct status level.

NIO,2021-01-10 15:45,"Thinking about it, it's probably better than 1.1, in a perfect scenario (there is always someone waiting for a battery), 13 batteries spare batteries with 3 hours charge time each, 39 changes a day, 1,170 a month, each car drives 3000km in a month on a 1000km battery, changes 3 times a month, 1170/3=390 cars a month served by the 13 batteries. 13/390=1.033, so you need 3.33% extra batteries to make it work in a perfect scenario, they probably do around 10% though to be sure.

The main reason I think Tesla has better chips than Nvidia is that Cathie Wood said so, so there's probably a chance I'm wrong on that. Tesla is still vertically integrated though and NIO isn't.

My main concern I guess is the rate of improvement with EVs, if e.g. Quantumscape release a battery that makes every other battery redundant, NIO would have to change over their supply. If an EV comes out thats cheaper/better than NIOs then customers could keep their cars less than 5 years, (I know people who swap out their BMWs every 2 years). I guess thats what all the efforts for brand loyalty are for? You make friends from being a NIO owner and don't want to leave the club.

It’s no longer true that the higher a camera’s megapixel count the better. The only thing more megapixels will give you is the ability to enlarge and crop pictures without individual pixels becoming visible. Objects get reduced into boxes anyway, higher resolutions don't help but higher megapixels dont give you better resolution anyway. Lidar is the most confusing part to me, why have it if you have cameras? The sensors are expensive, its like having a belt (cameras) and then spending $10k on braces.

NIO,2021-01-10 15:16,"True. It is 13 batteries to support the larger system, but Nio still earns more per battery this way than the ones they sell direct. 

Most EVs come with an 8 year / 150,000 mile battery warranty. 

Through the subscription model they pay for themselves after 5 years.

So if Nio only keep them in the system for a normal warranty period of 8 years/150,000 miles before recycling a battery, that's 3 years of subscription profit per owner or an extra $5.4k per car sold. 

Battery sold with car = $8k

Battery leased over 8 years = $13.4k

NIO,2021-01-10 10:46,"Hello there. 
Well, of course I lost some money but I don't feel too bad about the whole thing. 

It was interesting to see the market's reaction to news like the vaccine and Dems winning the Senate. Both stocks and yields spiked, however after the vaccine news both stocks and yields eased temporarily. 

It's clear that a lot of events are just sucked up by Algos. 

Of course one might argue ""bonds took a beating"" but I will counter that bond prices are still significantly higher than pre-crisis. So the market has seen an easing from the insanely high deflationary pressures we saw in early 2020 but on the other hand the market doesn't buy into the inflation hysteria and recovery of the real economy at all. 

If you look at the DXY it also fell quite a bit however I advocated for the usage of the trade weighted index calculated by the Fed itself. That index is still pretty high. 

At least for me, fundamentally nothing has changed. We see the actions of traditional banks in the weekly H.8 data. No growth in the credit market (I mean coronavirus crisis has started almost one year ago) while banks love to accumulate government protected securities like MBS and treasuries.

Regarding the actions of shadow banks (the ones which caused all the mania up until 2007), it's hard to look into that system. I can just vaguely assume that nothing has changed there because the Fed refuses to acknowledge that system as an offshore dollar system. The Fed is stubborn regarding its role as a US bank regulator. 

In that regard it was interesting to see what China thinks, mainly Xi Jinping. He repeated his idea of ""quality before quantity"" and made a new 5 year plan which is actually a 15 year plan. Of course there's always interpretation of words included but I think that even Xi himself doesn't believe in infinite growth and globally synchronized growth anymore. 

Fundamentally it's also important to acknowledge the weakness of stock markets every three months and this has been empirically hinted at many times, up until 2008. I couldn't get behind the true reason for this seasonality but the origins of this weakness are of historical nature (farmers leaving the big cities and coming back after a few months, taking their money with them). It's easy to see this in the SPY chart. 

Speaking of the SPY chart, if you look at March/June/September/December violent moves downwards aren't unusual, it's actually the opposite, they became the norm. We just focus on March 2020 because SPY went all the way down in that month. But pretty big drops happened in June 2020, September 2020, August 2019 (repo market crisis), May 2019, December 2018 (trade war? As you can see with coronavirus, money markets don't really care about these things, they only care about the money), October 2018, March 2018, February 2018.
On the other hand the best months to be long (hypothetically) would be the months after the quarter ends. January, April, July and October. 
Funnily a friend of mine asked me in the end of December whether he should sell some of his stocks like Nio but I said to hold because January will probably be great for stocks even though I have a bearish bias. Well until now I'm right. 

Why are the moves so violent? One hypothesis which I agree with is that active value investors are getting crowded out by passive investors. 
Active investors have always set an outside spread for assets. They're the people who say ""ok if SPY drops 20% I will buy as much as I can because the fundamentals will be good then"".
However as more and more people are flocking to passive investing via index funds the market has shifted. In normal times the constant and price-insensitive buying via index funds has propped up prices but in times of crisis the money inflows can't keep up with the selling pressure in those times.
If we compare 2020 to 2008 we see that after Lehman Brothers failed the drop in SPY wasn't even as severe as it was in March 2020 (where nothing - on the surface at least - failed). You would have thought that the world was doomed in 2008 but the stock market reacted way harder in March 2020.
You can draw your own conclusions from this. For me it's both the sign of a sick system and how passive investing has been undermining the mechanics of a true market for decades now.

Well that's enough for now.

OTM = out of the money = don't exercise the option
ITM = in the money = exercise the option (if you want to)
ATM = at the money = breakeven, no gains or losses if you exercise.

These mean different things based on which kind of contract you're talking about. If a purchased call is ITM, then the current stock price is greater than the strike price plus the premium you paid.

What happened in my case was that I saw PLUG and NIO were doing well, so I purchased some class with some money I had in my investment account. I then set sell-to-close limit orders for where I figured they would peak/hit, based on how the underlying stock was performing. This is actually my first win with options. I lost 300 bucks last year, and I'm about to lose 1k on 1/15 GME calls. What I did on 1/8 is definitely safer than what I've been doing with GME, so learn from my mistakes friend.

Before NIO's event, I was expecting it to be bad for Tesla. I expected Tesla stock to drop significantly on Monday.

But after watching NIO's event, I am convinced Nio is not going to eat Tesla's lunch anytime soon.


Nio really needed to announce a competitor to Model 3 or Model Y today. They did not. 
If you break down the presentation into individual parts and think about it, a lot of it is hyped up. 

Firstly, their long-range solid-state battery is not coming out anytime soon. The battery technology is not even theirs. So they are just the first to announce tech thats coming out in 2-3 years. Tesla has insane battery manufacturing capability compared to Nio.

Most importantly, who is this ET7 for? 
While tesla's model 3 and model y are getting cheaper by the day, a Chinese car manufacturer cannot build a price competitive EV? That is insane. ET7 is way too expensive for the mass market, hell, even Model 3 is kind of expensive for mass market. At least Tesla is moving in the right direction by reducing price routinely. Basically, Nio has surrendered the low-cost EV market to Tesla for another year or two.
Tesla has no competition in the sub $50k EV market and boy are they going to sell a ton of cars in that price range.",-0.073412698,-0.9094,0.081,0.883,0.036

NIO,2021-01-10 0:43,"Watched an abbreviated version of Nio Day. Not completely impressed. 

The biggest takeaway: lengthy timeframe to execute their technologies 

It will be approx 2 years until the new battery comes out. The battery technology is on steroid mode, industry wide. By then, Tesla and the EV industry will be on par at minimum or ahead. It appears Nio is leveraging ""time"" (years) to make their narrative appear more robust. 

Also, the Nio sedan is available in 1 year and still pricey even with subsidiaries.

Lidar is a questionable technology in autonomous driving and Nio going this route is maybe risky? The good news: Nio will be partnering with NVDA. And the CCP, an even better partner, will not let them fail.

NIO,2021-01-09 21:21,"You should edit that to shameful, because you’re spouting nonsense. The 150 kWh version makes perfect sense and in no way indicates inefficiency. This is telling in the first place because electric motors are hard to purposefully make inefficient—electromagnetic fields are susceptible to far fewer external forces than chemical reactions. 

Here are the details:
TSLA = Model 3 75 kWh; NIO = ET7 150 kWh (double capacity)

Range: TSLA = 353mi/568km; NIO = 650mi/1000km (expected)
You don’t need to be an engineer (though I am) to recognize this is justification alone. But let’s go further. 

Power: TSLA = 450 hp; NIO = 650 hp
More power equals bigger motor and requires more capacity to compensate for any loss of range at the expense of bigger motor.

Load: TSLA = 4072lb; NIO = ?? (presumably heavier, but unless it’s much lighter, not important)
Honestly, it’s impressive that they are able to get this much out of the 150 kWh battery compared to Tesla’s usage of a 75 kWh.

NIO,2021-01-09 4:39,The thing that’s got me worried about their battery swap is that currently every car company is battery constrained so they have to produce more than 1 battery for every car produced which is a short term problem atleast until battery supply catches up to demand. Also batteries are hopefully going to be changing rapidly so them having to hold onto batteries that are likely going to be obsolete in 5 years might not be great for them. I just looked into it and it looked like their total revenue was 666 million but 620 million came from vehicle sales and idk if that 46m included battery as a service fees so idk how much they can make in their clothing brands etc. I’ll watch nio day and see how that goes but I’m heavily considering shorting this stock lol so I appreciate whatever insight you’ve got that might help me make a smarter decision.,0.233333333,0.8826,0.078,0.813,0.109

Even if there’s only a few swapping stations, customers can swap out for larger batteries when taking road trips and use smaller batteries in cities. The housing and other extras are overblown imo.

Buy some shares of companies you believe in and trust in the next couple years(i have SPCE, PLTR, DKNG, ARKG and a few others) Id say at least half portfolio to keep you ""safe"".  the future is EV, software tech, solar energy, and betting lol NEVER SELL unless its to sell high and buy again when the stock dips. Keep buying dips steadily with the profits from options. My options, i only place when i am confident about something big within a month or two because options are guaranteed loss of money if executed poorly. I bought NIO options last month in preparation for NIO day.  DO NOT be afraid to simply have the cash waiting on a good oppurtunity. Better to wait on something good than to FOMO or YOLO and loose it all. BE DISCIPLINED. I would rather take a 30% gain than to be greedy if im not confident about something to hold overnight. The best advice ive received is: You never went broke taking profit. Another good example is buy LEAPs, they are options that expire in a year or more. I have one for DIS because I believe Disney will grow a lot this coming year. Can still make you a lot of money if done right. NEVER FOMO IF YOU MISSED OUT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.

NIO,2021-01-08 23:36,"I wonder how Amazon and Microsoft were with raising money in those days? Tesla was able to raise billions of dollars by simply selling stock last year. So they got free money to hire more bright engineers that rival the big boys like Google, Amazon, Apple to make the dream a reality. 

I'm also guessing that brain trust didn't exist in the '90s. The scale of projects and the ability for us to collaborate simply didn't exist in Y2K.

I would simply not invest in companies like Nio or Xpeng, especially given the recent environment in China. For example, delisting issues and 'where is Jack Ma?' Plug is also nonsense because it's based on fuel cell technology that doesn't exist or isn't practical. Think Nikola 2.0.

But if Tesla can get full self-driving &amp; robotaxis, using the best engineering team the world now has to offer, then the crash may never come. So the question becomes, how is the world different now than Y2K? And can we accelerate pie-in-the-ski timelines much faster than we could 20 years ago?

The company recently attracted attention due to another special feature. The battery is separated from the vehicle, which gives the technical opportunity to dramatically increase the range by lending or renting several batteries. After all, the company had received a new billion-dollar line of credit about a week ago. Lots of good news, but no longer matched in the share price.

NIO,2021-01-07 23:42,"&gt;In 10-15 years there is going to be a massive number of EVs on the road. Tesla is positioning themselves to dominate this market

A monopoly needs high barriers of entry. The EV market does not have high barriers of entry, there are other car manufacturers entering it, notably VW and NIO. 

In addition to that, Tesla is so ridiculously overpriced that they're worth more than every other car manufacturer in the world.  I agree Tesla is going to be a big player in the market, but to the point where they're outselling the competition combined. Tesla works in a very narrow space - Luxury cars with high profit margins. They won't be able to compete on the cheap EVs coming out of China, Japan, and elsewhere. 

And let's imagine a fantasy world where Telsa somehow has a 100% monopoly on the market. Tesla is worth 150% of the next 10 largest car companies combined. That means Tesla will not only need to sell more cars than they are all selling right now, they'll need to sell 50% more than that. 

That's assuming the stock doesn't grow at all for the next 10 years or so. 

That's how fucking retarded Tesla is. 

&gt;hey could be to EVs what microsoft was to OSs in the 90s

And where is Microsoft now? They've got a huge competitor. They don't dominate the market anymore.

Other than that my only long term play is ICLN. Holding options from about 6 months ago and they just keep printing so I’m letting those bake.

Weed stocks will get as high as me right now but experience the same crash into a level of sleep that’s good for the soul 

Tesla will continue to moon because it’s in the SP500 therefore it will never fail. Also because Musk is a visionary and Tesla can control 4 sectors simultaneously. All the while being backed by a generation of gamblers, space folks and potheads that will use Tesla stock as a savings account over a real bank.

The same call expiring next January will cost you $1,800. 

If NIO closed at $65 on Friday, your short dated option would be worth $500 at expiration, meaning you made 1,150%. 

To make a reasonable guess as to what the leap would earn, we can look at what a call $5 in the money for that expiration date is worth.  Approximately $2,200, so you’d have earned $350 on your $1,800 investment, or 19.4%. 

Granted, you are very unlikely to make a pick like the short dated option correctly, but if you do, the returns are not similar to if you’d bought a leap instead. 

And to be clear, I think you were asking something like a leap was something different all together.  It’s not.  It’s just nomenclature for a long dated option.

I also think that China would be less likely to stop buying REE from $MP too because the demand for them to build new technology for the futures is so high (ex: Green energy ). $NIO, $XPeng and $Li have been shooting to the sky this year all because the government is willing to pour as much money as they need to reach green energy.

In September, President Xi Jinping announced that **China** will endeavor to reduce its carbon emissions to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 ). These are the type of commitment that China is making and it won't be long for the gasoline cars to go always. I think they would be likely to collaborate with others and consume more REEs to reach that goal rather than creating enemies and not investing in companies like $MP could deliver valuables resources.

Looks like there may be a bump tomorrow with this news... ques is when do i sell?  Tomorrow when i think its topping or should i wait to Tue or Wed?  Theta will be on the clock all week.  
You you think vega will build throughout the week with this news and 9jan approaching just as it does as earnings day approaches?  I guess the trick is to find the balance between theta and vega?

That’s the danger of every meme stock. Companies who deserve the valuation (eventually) get overbought way too early.

GME is going to suffer from the same issue as well. It gets hardcore pulled so retail assumes the sentiment means the stock price is going to continue moving up in the near term.

This will be one of those situations in which TSLA posts great earnings and drops for ""no reason"". Also, all the other auto manufacturers will be releasing their EV lines late 2021 and into 2022, so competition increases, which increases TSLA's dependence on their need to develop their AI and green energy markets. Keep in mind, TSLA still didn't have a positive EPS in q3 from car sales alone, they needed the sale of $397M in regulatory tax credits in q3 to post their $313M positive earnings. Not being able to get into the black on the sale of 500K vehicles at a ~$50K average sale price without the sale of over $1B in regulatory tax credits is worrisome.

I do believe it will be tough and that most people won’t want to buy them simply because they are Chinese but if Nio continues to put out quality cars and at a competitive price I think people will have no choice but to consider them as an option. Also whether we like it or not China is increasingly looking like they are going to be the super power of the world. Right now their economy is booming for all working classes and people are happy in China right now. In turn this will lead to more spending and the trickle down effect begins. I wish I had more tsla but I believe Nio has more upside in the next couple years which I why I’m heavily invested in them. I think both will do great things.,0.287385129,0.9846,0.021,0.796,0.183

Sure, both of those to the moon maybe, but TSLA will never dominate in China and NIO will never even gain a foothold in the US.
